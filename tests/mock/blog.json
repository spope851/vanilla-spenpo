These conversations are lightly edited for clarity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003EThe Problem\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENow that I've posted to my blog over ten times, I ran into the scaling issue of only seeing the ten most recent posts on my homepage. When requesting the posts from my CMS, (WordPress), it responds with a maximum of ten posts by default. WordPress assumes that consumers will use pagination, meaning that page two of the blog will display the next ten posts. I hadn't programmed that feature yet, so I bumped the \u003Ccode\u003Eper_page\u003C/code\u003E limit to eleven and added a comment reminding myself to replace the bandaid with a scalable solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cpre class=\"wp-block-code language-tsx\"\u003E\u003Ccode\u003Eexport default async function Blog() {\n  // TODO: add pagination and remove per_page query\n  const posts = await fetch(`${WP_REST_URI}/posts?per_page=11`)\n                        .then((res) =&gt; res.json()\u003C/code\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELast week I implemented pagination like I've done for plenty of other projects, by storing the page number in the URL search query and using that value to request the appropriate posts from WordPress. I added those \"next page\" and \"last page\" buttons we all know and love to the bottom of the page and was done. However, this time, I didn't write any of the code. Features like this are so prolific in web development that AI can figure them out in seconds. And, if you code in an AI-enabled environment like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.cursor.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ECursor\u003C/a\u003E, it can just do everything for you. \u003Ca href=\"https://claude.ai/new\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003EClaude\u003C/a\u003E suggested all the code changes and all I had to do was apply and accept them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, I'm not even the engineer for my own site anymore! For features like this, my role is to delegate to the chatbots and review their code. This is a major productivity unlock that allows me to spend less time on backlog tasks and more on creative work. I used all the time it saved to build a component that displays AI chats for my blog. I'm going to start publishing \"Conversations with AI\" so that others can check out what I'm using it for.

          "rendered": "\n\u003Cp\u003EI'm now a fourth-grade teacher in Shanghai, China. This is a significant career shift from software development that I'm glad to be embracing. At the end of 2023, I found myself on the job hunt unexpectedly. Though I wouldn't have chosen it, it also served as a period of reflection that I welcomed. During this time I explored many alternative career paths that we, (in our 20s), have the luxury to consider. A few months in I took an impromptu trip to East Asia to visit an old travel buddy who had just started working there. I spent the bulk of my days in Shanghai and also took several small excursions including \u003Ca href=\"https://pope.love/pub.php#elephant_mountain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ETaipei\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://pope.love/pub.php#guangzhou\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003EGuangzhou\u003C/a\u003E, and \u003Ca href=\"https://pope.love/pub.php#shenzhen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003EShenzhen\u003C/a\u003E. Exploring these dynamic eastern cities was energizing and left me enthralled with the nostalgia of my first trip to China in 2019. I found that there is high demand here for English teachers, as the 2020 pandemic drove many Western expats out of the region. The friend I was visiting came here to fill a teaching position at a private school, and after meeting his employer I was excited to return home with job offers for both my wife and me.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"teachingInChina\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"#teachingInChina\"\u003ETeaching in China\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe school year has begun, and I'm neck-deep in a new world. For the most part, my days look like any teacher's would. I get up early, walk the dog, and start my commute. I make coffee in the teachers' lounge before heading to my classroom to greet my co-teacher. My class prep consists mostly of file management and using the printer. Of course, there are also many distinctions since this is a bilingual school in China. Our primary school has eight class periods per day, three of which are taught in English by yours truly. The others are taught in Chinese, so each homeroom is equipped with one national and one foreign teacher. This is a great dynamic, as we split all the classroom duties outside of teaching like decorating, recess, and discipline. We also help each other circumvent the ever-present language barrier. Teaching has proven to be a fun job, though at the core it's administrative like any other. Many of my consistent todos have their parallels with the less sexy duties of corporate knowledge workers. The fun part is giving lessons, which is a calculated performance and a test of wits. Uncertainty is unavoidable, as student receptiveness varies across topics. Trying to get twenty kids to understand something new about a foreign language is an interesting game. There are good and bad days, and when a lesson doesn't go as planned, the need to change one's approach is undeniable. That's one example of the many instances as a teacher in which I'm glad for my background in software. Taking an agile approach to teaching has me treating each week like a sprint and each lesson like a user story. This analogy may earn some more thought in the future, as the agile methodology has proven to be the best way to work in many of my life's pursuits, which still holds up in teaching.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"stillCoding\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"#stillCoding\"\u003EStill coding\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven't stopped programming since I stopped working as a programmer. My \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://spenpo.com/projects\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Eprojects\u003C/a\u003E continue to grow in numbers, and I regularly update my \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://spenpo.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Epersonal website\u003C/a\u003E, which is a long-running project in itself. Recently, I've been optimizing the site's content management strategy. My blog has been available on my website for a while now, and all of that feature's data is stored in a database managed by WordPress. Used in this manner, WordPress acts as a \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/glossary/headless-wordpress/#first-what-is-a-headless-cms\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Eheadless CMS\u003C/a\u003E. A CMS is an application used for storing static content, and headless means the application doesn't come with a front end. It is only concerned with managing content, and the way that content is displayed is up to consumers. My website consumes the CMS via WordPress's built-in REST API, so when I write my posts in WordPress's text editor, they magically appear on my website too. I've started to move towards this approach for all text content on my site. Features like the \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://spenpo.com/home\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Ehome\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://spenpo.com/about\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Eabout\u003C/a\u003E pages are primarily text, so they are better stored and easier to update in a CMS. One feature I haven't been able to integrate with the CMS is my \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://spenpo.com/resume\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Eresume page\u003C/a\u003E. I built a custom widget to display the contents of my resume, and that content wouldn't be nicely organized to fit into the widget if I just threw it all into a WordPress post. Adding resume-specific data tables to the WordPress database would make it much easier for consumers to use that data the way I intended, and for me to update my resume in the future. It's a good thing WordPress is open source, and their data models can be extended to achieve this. I can also build a plugin that will act as the CMS for the new data tables, enabling me to update my resume from a custom WordPress view that I get to design. I'm still at the drawing board on this project, and it's potentially a much larger undertaking than I anticipated, but it will be a great opportunity to learn how to develop a plugin and work with technologies I'm less familiar with like \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mysql.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003EMySQL\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://php.net\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003EPHP\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technicalCertification\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"#technicalCertification\"\u003ETechnical certification\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere's no denying that teaching fourth grade for a year will leave a gap in my technical resume. It's the kind of gap I'll be excited to explain someday, but I want to stay ahead of the curb and start building my defense early. Technical projects that I develop independently are part of this, and I've decided that certifications will supplement the professional dimension of my continued enrichment. Now that the only formal work I'm doing is as a freelancer, earning well-known certifications will show that I'm still serious about a career in software. I'm starting with AWS since it's the platform I've used the most, and I was able to pass the Certified Cloud Practitioner exam with relative ease. The second-handedness of getting certified to display my competence is troubling because ideally, my work would speak for itself without the need for credentials. And given the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tech-certifications-worth-the-effort/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Emixed opinions\u003C/a\u003E on some of these certs, I never gave them much thought while I was employed. But, the reality is my live projects do not require the scale or elasticity needed to justify premium cloud providers, so I've opted for \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kx_1NYYJS7Q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Ebudget infrastructure\u003C/a\u003E to reduce their expenses. Though I can speak to my experience with these platforms, tangible proof that you've used Azure, GCP, or AWS is always best, and I can secure that by sitting for a few tests. If nothing else, they ought to serve as helpful refreshers too. I plan to earn the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification in the next few weeks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"learningMandarin\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"#learningMandarin\"\u003ELearning Mandarin\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven't left behind the original reason I came to China during college. Though I'm not currently a student, I make a point of taking an interest in the language here. In America however, I fail masterfully at convincing myself to study foreign languages. I excelled in Spanish class for the first half of high school, but I dropped out my junior year at the first sign of difficulty. I couldn't justify enduring the subject. I draw a parallel from that experience to studying Chinese, which I was happy to engage in during my trip to Beijing, but found impossible to keep up upon my return. Embarrassingly, I have sunk scores of hours into a \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://spenpo.com/projects/language-flash\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Esoftware project\u003C/a\u003E designed to help me study Mandarin in part, just to avoid the study itself. Luckily moving to Shanghai has made this study non-negotiable. I'm constantly learning new words and speaking tactics from my friends, neighbors, and colleagues. The opportunity to apply my training in my daily affairs is motivating enough to engage me. I hope to formalize my studies soon in order to increase my rate of progress. Foreign speaker Vitalik Buterin has \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/categories/translations.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Eentire blog posts\u003C/a\u003E that can be read in Chinese characters, and though I don't claim to possess genius approximating his, I think such a display of competence is achievable for many.

My wife and I also exercise in a gym a few days a week when I listen to any other podcast episodes I've marked or the audiobook of \u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003EAtlas Shrugged\u003C/a\u003E. These sessions only include resistance training and stretching, as my cardio has been substantially offloaded to our daily walks, bike rides, and regular weekends dedicated to urban tourism. Occasionally I'll take the short jog or long walk down to the Huangpu River promenade we're lucky to live in such proximity to.

          "rendered": "\n\u003Cp\u003ELast year I developed one old belief and one new one. The old one is that it is not necessary to be an employee in exchange for a good life. Good lives are lived in abundance all over the world, especially in the United States. Yet, it remains clear that predictable income through gainful employment is the bedrock of the American dream. A salary funds a savings account and a tax-advantaged retirement account while providing for life’s necessities. Eventually, the savings account evolves into a home that represents a family’s wealth through equity. If the family still wants more they can use that equity to back a business venture that may turn them some profits and increase their wealth. If not, they may remain employed and sustain any luxuries they’ve grown accustomed to. I believe that this plan is still alive and well today and that its careful execution will lead to a good life. It is also my belief that creativity can be invoked to tailor the plan to slightly different results or to completely reimagine it for disproportionate ones. I’ve consistently held, questioned, and reevaluated this belief to keep my mind open to creative enhancements of the plan and divergent paths away from it. To me, the plan is rooted in one idea; To act with a plentiful payment in mind and save the fruits of your labor until they’ve grown enough to sustain your life for its remainder. A salary of the right size and security fits wonderfully into this thesis but is only one strategic pursuit in the forum for action where we exist. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new belief I’ve developed is that risk and reward average out over a lifetime. Incurring risk is inevitable and living may be considered perpetual risk management. There is risk in leaving the house today, just as there is risk in staying there. Evaluating which risk you prefer produces the resulting action you will take. The first paragraph of this essay illustrates a high-level evaluation of risk throughout an average American’s lifespan. Each move, conscious of risk, incurs just enough to sustain a good life. Taking the job is a risk, saving the money is a risk, buying the house is a risk, and starting the business is a risk just as not doing so is. Risk is incurred in anticipation of reward, which is why we act. Due to the inevitability of risk, human action at scale is commonly justified by a distillation of risk and reward known as opportunity. Holding the belief stated in the first paragraph in my mind led me to understand the necessity of risk and develop these new beliefs. Regardless of how much truth they contain, I’ve used them to guide my curiosity into the exploration of a space crawling with new opportunities that present an impressive matrix of risk and reward. That space is the marketplace for small businesses. At the midpoint of 2023, I rebalanced my portfolio of interests and reallocated a considerable amount of human capital toward buying an existing business. The purpose of this essay is not to argue the bombastic assertions stated in these first two paragraphs. I will continue to question those and welcome your help in doing so, but hereon will be discussing the opportunity to test these beliefs by buying a business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESix months ago I discovered \u003Ca href=\"https://www.codiesanchez.com/\"\u003ECodie Sanchez\u003C/a\u003E on \u003Ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Dm4ITQAUN6DhiW8ue6e1T?si=9820d9e81ca74c7f\"\u003Ean episode\u003C/a\u003E of Steven Barton’s podcast. Throughout the interview she told the story of her fascinating career from journalism to Wall Street to small/medium-sized business, (SMB), investing, and now onto building a new \u003Ca href=\"https://contrarianthinking.co/\"\u003Emedia and education company\u003C/a\u003E, (of which I’m a customer). She told the story of how she gradually transitioned out of corporate life and into the world of owning and operating SMBs. The concept was completely new to me that day. I’d always been interested in transitioning out of my 9 to 5 but hadn’t yet come up with a plan I was willing to pursue. I’ve been a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-wantrepreneur#:~:text=All%20related%20(41),steps%20to%20actually%20become%20one.\"\u003Ewantrepreneur\u003C/a\u003E ever since joining the workforce. I study, talk, and dream about all the ways I might start making my own money so I can stop working for companies. But, I’ve never put a plan into action because everything I come up with is too risky for my comfort level. In that pod, Codie made buying a business sound like the opportunity I’d been looking for. She bought her first laundromat for $100k and made $67k in profit in her first year operating it. That amount pails in comparison to a salary from Goldman Sachs, but it comes along with an invisible reward that most jobs don’t; wealth. People buy businesses because they’re cash-flowing assets. Cash flow is a common metric used for measuring value, and SMBs sell for an average of two to three times annual cash flow. Codie’s laundromat was valued at $100k when she bought it, but after a year she proved it could be worth $134-201k. So, after a year of modest take-home pay, she doubled the potential value of her investment. One thing that never changes about a corporate job is how valuable it is to you once you stop working, (hint: $0). Then again, working for a big company isn’t nearly as risky. After hearing about Codie’s stunning 67% ROI, I knew I had to take a closer look. Let’s talk about how this is possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EImagine someone has already done the extremely difficult thing that is starting a business. That thing that I stay employed because I’m too afraid to try; they did it! They built a business that humans go to and pay money for goods or services. Not only that, but it costs them less to run the business than their customers are paying them. This means that after a year it might’ve cost them $500k to run the business, but their customers paid them $600k for their work, so they made a $100k profit. Incredible. That person is an entrepreneur and gets to live off of their profits instead of waiting for a biweekly direct deposit. Now imagine this person doesn’t want to run their business anymore. They’re onto greener pastures and have decided to leave this venture behind. Doing so is quite a pain in the neck. Let’s say it’s a laundromat. The owner has to sell a bunch of used laundry machines on the open market for next to nothing. They have to get out of their lease and lay off all their staff. Also, what about their customers? They all have to find somewhere else to wash their clothes. The place they buy their detergent from is out a customer, and several other microeconomies will be disrupted by the business closing its doors. Not only that but think of all the time and money it will cost this person to shut down their business so that they can move on from it. It just isn’t worth it. Those used washers and detergent suppliers and lease agreements are worth far more carefully packaged into a business and positioned in the market than they are inconveniently scattered throughout the world. For this reason, the logical way for owners to separate from a profitable business has become selling the whole business as a cohesive product that another entrepreneur can pick right up with. This process boils down to finding a buyer who is willing to pay the owner in exchange for their business’s assets and the right to operate it. That person takes over all the responsibilities of the previous owner, including all associated risks and rewards. Codie made a deal like that with the owner of a laundromat when she was twenty-three. They wanted $100k for their business, so Codie offered to give them $100k plus interest over the next several years. This is known as seller financing. If you can’t, (or don’t want to), pay full price for something right now, you can borrow some of the money instead and pay your lender back over time. Seller financing means the seller “lends” you that money. Instead of giving them $100k for their business right now, you might give them a $20k down payment and then another $20k plus interest for the next four years. If this were Codie’s deal and she was making a $67k profit in each of those years, then over $40k of that would be going right into her pocket, and once the loan was paid off, all of it would be.&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECodie’s story amazed me because there are so many ways to put it into practice. She found a business that she could operate in her spare time while keeping her day job. She would still go to work for a company while customers were going into her laundromat for a wash. After work, she’d mop the floors at the laundromat, refill the detergent, and collect the change from the machines. It might sound crazy to do all that on top of a full-time job for an extra $40k, but she saw it as much more. Codie was building an empire. $40k was the visible metric she did all that work for, but the invisible one she also got was experience. Once she made that deal she became CEO of Codie’s Laundry. A business owner. An entrepreneur. This is meaningful whether you keep your corporate job or not. Buying a business is a sort of graduation to business ownership where you become responsible for that business’s results. Just because you purchased something that turned a $40k profit last year doesn’t mean you can’t operate it to make more this year. Making a bad decision at work will not impact the amount on your paystub that week. Making a good one might get you a raise at some point. Running a business is different in that the quality of your decisions is directly reflected in its profits. There is an inherent risk in accepting that responsibility that, if managed properly, can yield great rewards. Not to mention Codie was building equity in her new asset. If she kept the business running the same way it already was and pocketed $40k per year while she was paying off her loan, she would’ve made a $160k cash profit in those four years while also purchasing an asset that makes $67k per year. She can keep enjoying that cash flow, or she can turn around and sell it. She could sell it for the same price she bought it for and start getting paid $20k per year as the seller. That’s half the cash flow without doing any of the work. There are endless ways to play this game. She could put more effort into the business and grow it so that it’s worth even more. Maybe it cash flows $100k at that point and she hires someone to operate the business for $50k per year. The other $50k goes into her pocket and she doesn’t have to do any work. Then what? She can keep working her 9 to 5 and stick that extra $50k in the bank. Start a family. Probably retire early. Or she could do it again. Buy another laundromat, rinse, repeat. If she pulls it off again she’d have two businesses producing a total of $100k per year in passive income. Codie did this until she owned over twenty businesses that produced 50 million dollars in yearly cash flow.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI love a good story and that one was plenty for me. I decided to learn how to buy a business. Turns out there are a ton of different ways. People have been doing this for decades and there’s a pretty dense internet paper trail documenting the evolution of their practices. Institutions as prestigious as Harvard have even gone to great lengths to productize the idea and market it to their MBA students as a worthy career path. Harvard Business Review published a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/HBR-Guide-Buying-Small-Business-ebook/dp/B01KP33K4Y/ref=sr_1_1?crid=235P4F1USOU3Q&amp;keywords=hbr+guide+to+buying+a+small+business&amp;qid=1703874296&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=hbr+gu%2Cdigital-text%2C185&amp;sr=1-1\"\u003Elittle red book\u003C/a\u003E that has become one of the bibles of this space, along with \u003Ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Buy-Then-Build-Acquisition-Entrepreneurs-ebook/dp/B07JKM2F5Q/ref=sr_1_1?crid=18F85A8258OIK&amp;keywords=buy+then+build&amp;qid=1703874353&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=Buy+th%2Cdigital-text%2C129&amp;sr=1-1\"\u003EBuy Then Build\u003C/a\u003E by Walker Deibel. And whether they’re talking about the illustrious study of ETA, (entrepreneurship through acquisition), the highbrow field of M&amp;A, (mergers and acquisitions), or the lowbrow conversation of just “buying businesses”, they’re all discussing the same thing. It’s like making cheese; the plan is always the same, but the process varies slightly. Private equity firms are cooking up nutty and sophisticated Parmigiano-Reggianos, but that doesn’t mean individuals can’t tweak the process a little and end up with a nice block of cheddar to get them out of the rat race. The plan is no different than the simple idea brought forth at the beginning of this essay. Anytime people discuss risky behavior with this level of nuance, it comes down to the same pragmatic motivations: do work, create wealth, and have a good life. I’ve been meditating on such life-spanning ideas down to worries that span days or hours ever since I heard Codie on that pod, and it’s all still moving me with conviction that the opportunity for a very good life lies in buying a business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI started with a pretty firehose approach to getting smart on how this all works. It’s how I tend to approach anything that interests me. I kept all the time I needed to keep the lights on at my day job blocked out on my calendar, and scraped together the rest of my free time for studying. I read books, consumed other free content, and paid to join conversations with other ambitious folks. The truth about the internet’s “dense paper trail” on this subject is that it only appears that way if you know where to look. It’s a collection of case studies documented throughout humans’ experiences over the last century or so. Listening to lots of conversations and having some of your own makes it easier to compile those experiences and pull out the knowledge people have gained from them. Like I said earlier, the process is up to you, but the plan is simple. I laid down the ABCs of buying a small biz in a hypothetical story a few paragraphs ago. First, you find a business. Next, you buy it. Finally, you run that business. How the heck you go from that to quitting your job and driving a Range Rover is exactly what everyone’s trying to figure out, but if you’ve already bought into trying, those three steps are where you should focus your energy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003EStep 1\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are many ways to find a business to buy. So many that this one step has earned the posh moniker “deal sourcing”. The important thing to understand here is that there are lots of businesses out there and only so much time in the day. If you had unlimited time and resources you could start by walking outside and going into the first business you see to strike up a conversation about selling. Since almost nobody has that luxury, the conversation around deal sourcing involves getting specific on the kind of business you want and how you’re going to find it. It’s sort of like dating. You could take the cold approach and start walking into businesses and shaking owners’ hands. This is called proprietary outreach and many search entrepreneurs have gotten a deal out of it. The savvy ones send out email or direct mail blasts to thousands of businesses at a time asking if they are interested in selling. If you took this approach to getting a date, you would get some, but it’s a numbers game. Since you might not even know if they’re single, you should be prepared to repeat the process ad nauseam before you find someone whose situation is right for you. Searchers have taken this as far as hiring teams of interns to reach out on their behalf and building out sales funnels that lead prospects down their acquisition pipeline. It can be very time-consuming, luckily there are places you can look where you’re more likely to meet single ladies. Crowded bars, nightclubs, and dating apps all have analogs in the world of buying businesses. Since both scenes are leaning remote these days, let's focus on online listings. Enter \u003Ca href=\"https://bizbuysell.com\"\u003EBizbuysell\u003C/a\u003E; Tinder for SMBs. This is a website where anyone can list a business for sale and the public can browse at their leisure. I’ve also heard people compare it to a thrift store, meaning there’s a bunch of crap for sale but if you look for long enough you can find something good. They have everything from failing businesses on the road to bankruptcy to profitable operations with scores of employees. A business owner might post their business there to try selling it themself, or it might be represented by a broker who is looking for potential buyers on behalf of the owner. This underworld is so vibrant that quite a lot of business goes on just to service it. Working with a broker comes with the advantage of having someone who's done this before, but they also get a cut of the purchase price, and you better believe the seller has priced that in. Also, once you’ve met a broker in the context of one business, it’s customary to ask them about any other deals they’re working on. If they take you seriously they might keep you in mind. Getting on a broker’s “shortlist” is the special treatment of being told about new deals before they’re listed to the public. So, networking with brokers, browsing listing sites, and proprietary outreach are all tactics that can produce results when looking for a business, and a healthy mix of them can build out a substantial deal pipeline for anyone who wants to take this field seriously.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETelling everyone you know and meet that you want to buy a business also won’t hurt. I’ve been doing it all whilst loitering around the common business owner water coolers in my city. Chambers of Commerce, Meetups, and Rotary Clubs are just a few examples where you’ll find willing listeners for your wantrepreneurial dreams. I’ve met a lot of folks and had some amazing conversations from this, but again, it’s a slow burn. The connections you make in that arena compound over a lifetime and are invaluable in that sense, but if you’re looking for businesses that are ready to sell yesterday nothing beats brokerages and listing sites. After digging into material and combing through listings for weeks I found a business that I could see fitting nicely into my life. This Anytime Fitness franchise gym location was priced at $350k and boasted a cash flow of $130k. Affordable, profitable, and two blocks down the street from my apartment, I fell in love right away just like they told me not to. That price tag might sound anything but affordable, but small business acquisitions can be financed with up to 90% debt through the United States Government’s legendary \u003Ca href=\"https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/7a-loans\"\u003ESBA 7a loan\u003C/a\u003E. With that in mind, I pictured putting up $35k to tac $130k onto my salary. The Range Rover was practically already leased. I called the number on the BizBuySell listing at 4 PM and one of the owners picked up. Five minutes later I was in their office.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst meetings with sellers are the best. I queried delicately for their motivations in selling. A young couple nowhere near retirement age, they were not the archetypal baby boomers selling their life’s work. The search community prides itself on its awareness of the “\u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_tsunami\"\u003Esilver tsunami\u003C/a\u003E,” which is the factual trend of baby boomers simultaneously owning the majority of small businesses in America and retiring at the growing rate of over ten thousand per day. This trend has created new popularity around buying businesses, as the necessary transfer of wealth it begs is inviting to curious investors. Someone has to take over those SMBs or else we’re going to be at a loss for necessary labor. Some go as far as to speculate that blue-collar work will surpass white-collar in value as technological advancements cause demand for the latter to wane. That said, the gym owner before me that day was not a tsunami contributor. This was the first letdown, as retirees are advantageous partners in the eyes of a buyer. The foremost reason for which being that they are likely to be open-minded to the idea of seller financing, even if they aren’t familiar with the term. Monthly payments offer tax advantages to the seller, and many would prefer sustained income in their first few years of retirement as opposed to a lump sum. A mid-forties couple selling their franchise location might have different goals for the transaction and these folks were no exception. I was there with the husband of the duo, and he told me about the liquidity event they were looking for. They planned to relocate to another state, and they wanted all the money upfront so they could start a new venture in their new home. Seller financing wasn’t going to do it for these folks. I pressed on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI pulled at the strand of their relocation. Selling a business is a big life change, and when one such change is accompanied by friends of its likeness, it’s prudent to suspect that passion guided those decisions. Fear spurs frequent revisions just as a manic teenager gets a new girlfriend, grade point average, and hairdo all in one season. It turned out their relocation was imminent, and the man’s wife had already carried out the move. He was splitting time between the gym and their new home several states away, and their last order of business was to get the gym sold. Flags were everywhere. Red flags? Who's to say? Flags nonetheless. I haven’t even gotten to the fact that it’s a franchise yet, which begs a word of caution from any searcher. We ended that meeting without opening the closet in search of skeletons, but in agreement that he would send me some financial documents where I would inevitably find them. A first glance I found that revenue was down from the previous year and they weren’t banking anywhere near $130k in free cash flow. BizBuySell notoriously misrepresents the \u003Cem\u003Ecash-flow-based \u003C/em\u003Emetric of \u003Ca href=\"https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/accounting/sellers-discretionary-earnings/#:~:text=Seller's%20discretionary%20earnings%20is%20a,related%20business%20incomes%20and%20expenses.\"\u003Eseller’s discretionary earnings\u003C/a\u003E, (SDE), as “cashflow”, which is an understandable fib in their line of business. I will go over the differences between the two and their cousin, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp#:~:text=EBITDA%2C%20or%20earnings%20before%20interest,generated%20by%20the%20company's%20operations.\"\u003EEBITDA\u003C/a\u003E, in a later post. It was naive of me to believe that figure. Further digging revealed plenty more bony bodies hanging amongst their attire, but that’s what I was there for. Digging is learning and searchers are business archeologists hoping to uncover a relic none of their colleagues were careful enough to notice. I found lots of worthless scraps and dusted off the occasional deblume, each time learning something new about this curious process. After a few weeks of meetings I was overwhelmed with information and the sellers were getting skittish. Motivated sellers want to see a commitment from potential buyers so that they can visualize a timeline for their payday. So, I drafted a \u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_intent\"\u003Eletter of intent\u003C/a\u003E, (LOI), to buy their gym which we both signed. This is a formal agreement that when properly written is not legally binding, and therefore can be executed by a buyer and seller as an intermediate step in their relationship. Traditionally in search, signing such a letter marks the time when the seller stops marketing the sale to potential buyers and provides more sensitive documents, like tax returns, to the buyer. The period that follows is commonly referred to as due diligence, (DD), and it’s said to be the time when the most truth comes out and the actual deal is sorted out before it’s struck. Many searchers urge the prioritization of due diligence to expedite finding out if the business is worth your time or not. The founder of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.guardianduediligence.com/\"\u003EGuardian Due Diligence\u003C/a\u003E, a firm specializing in this practice, goes as far as urging searchers to “\u003Ca href=\"https://acquiringminds.co/articles/elliott-holland-guardian-due-diligence\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ewrite the darn LOI\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cem\u003E,” \u003C/em\u003Einsisting that any information provided before DD is insufficient for the decisions needing to be made from a buyer’s perspective.&nbsp; For that reason, I put the sellers’ original asking price on the document and away we went. I was officially committed to buying my first business.&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEarlier I alluded to a cliche in the space which is not to, “fall in love with the first deal”. Many spread these wise words because it’s a commonly understood trend that the first time you get near a business you see it for all of its appeal and none of its shortcomings. Think of your first boyfriend or girlfriend. The infatuation, the new identity you award yourself for embracing this opportunity, and the desire for its justification to prevail. You live two or three entire lives in your head during those moments following a new commitment. I was dead set on the pious life of a remote programmer and a gym owner. I’d write some code for a paycheck during the day, coach my teammates, and maybe take a few meetings. Outside of those duties, I’d patrol my iron kingdom, talk with my happy customers, and now and then balance the QuickBooks. It was a wonderful life and I was ready to dive right into it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003EStep 2\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimilar to step one, there are many ways to buy a business once you’ve found it. Or, due to our human obsession with options, it seems that way. However, there is only one true way to buy a business, which is to pay for it. Folks allow some air to breathe in their definition of money when selling a business, which can lead to fascinating agreements where both parties feel they’ve won. 80% seller financing with 20% cash upfront is a pretty epic deal to pull off, and there are plenty of other ways to skin that cat. Codie also talks about the crown jewel of 100% seller financing where there is no down payment from the buyer and they only pay the seller back with future profits. The art of deal-making is a dance between self-interested parties who must act in both their own and each others’ best interests for optimal results. So, if incentives align, an agreement can be made that looks unbelievable to spectators. It’s an abstract pursuit that can only be understood in practice. Though 100% seller financing is a mouth-watering idea to most buyers, it will always come with drawbacks. Since it is one of the less traditional methods in the space, you won’t have as many businesses to choose from if you’re only interested in seller financing. The more traditional method would be to borrow the money from \u003Cem\u003Esomeone else\u003C/em\u003E. If you go this route your deal could still look \u003Cem\u003Ealmost \u003C/em\u003Ethe same as the one I described earlier. You would give a down payment to someone other than the seller, (likely a bank), and they would lend you the amount you need to buy the business. You give that money to the seller and boom, the business now belongs to you, (and your friendly neighborhood lender). In the preceding years hopefully, you make enough money to pay the lender back and own the business outright. It’s the same story except the seller exits stage left halfway through to make way for this new lender character. Once you’ve found a business and engaged the seller, closing the deal is about working with them to determine how that act plays out. The possibilities are endless and the level of creativity employed in your deal is up to you and the seller. I’ve met searchers who’ve ruled out the idea of owning less than 100% of the business after closing, which means they aren’t open to borrowing any money. The obvious drawback there would be that they have to pay for the whole thing themself, with the advantage being that they have nobody to answer to. The process boils down to risk tolerance and time preference. If you’re willing to risk other people’s money and the seller prefers to be paid now, you’re probably going to finance the deal with a bank loan. Working out such a loan is endlessly arousing, which is why I’m going to save that topic for a future post.&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo sum step two up, buying the business is where real risk is taken and the interested parties need to determine if the proposed deal can be struck. If written correctly, (with the help of a lawyer), the LOI from step 1 is not legally binding and can be voided by either party without consequence. Step two, however, traditionally culminates with the signing of a legally binding asset purchase agreement (APA). This document ought to be reviewed by each party’s lawyers and gives a clear path to litigation to one side, should the other violate the terms. It’s the equivalent of putting your money where your mouth is. \u003Ca href=\"https://stevenpressfield.com/2023/08/training-turning-pro/\"\u003ESteven Pressfield\u003C/a\u003E would refer to step one as amateur ETA, while step two is turning pro. An APA is drafted with protections for both sides but is meant to consider all possible outcomes so that each party can proceed with confidence. Negotiation is much heavier on an APA due to the difference in legal nature. It’s common for both parties to be uncharacteristically cordial while drafting an LOI in hopes of advancing the deal. For instance, I gladly put the purchase price the seller was asking for on our LOI, though I had little confidence I’d be willing to pay that after reviewing their preliminary documents. This is a common strategy for getting that darn LOI signed because sellers in this market often start with irrational asking prices, and starting the due diligence process is a way to open their minds to the facts of the situation. I attempted to do so by engaging bankers, several of whom told me they weren’t willing to finance the transaction. Relaying this to the sellers is called the “blame it on the bank” strategy, and is meant to neutralize the seller with an expert’s opinion. Telling them why \u003Cem\u003Eyou \u003C/em\u003Ewant to lower the price is akin to calling the sellers’ baby ugly while telling them you can’t get the money \u003Cem\u003Eunless \u003C/em\u003Ethey do so is a logical argument based on a professional appraisal of value. And, getting comparable opinions from multiple lenders will only strengthen the case, leading the sellers to believe most buyers would run into similar issues. However, this strategy can backfire. The more bankers you present the deal to the more likely you are to find one with an above-average risk tolerance. So, just because you find someone willing to fund your deal, does not mean you should go through with it. After engaging well over three banks, I was able to find a couple who were interested in my deal. Excellent news, though it didn’t change the fact that I wanted a better price, and likely needed one to run the business sustainably. This is why honesty is pivotal to the buyer/seller relationship from day one. I still think it’s ok to do what you have to do to engage the seller, though negotiation still ought to be sprinkled throughout the timeline. Consistently painting the seller’s intentions in a favorable light sends the wrong message, and can make the start of negotiations seem abrupt. This was the pitfall of my deal. I had gotten loan proposals from a couple of lenders and was considering signing one if I could get the sellers to come down in price.&nbsp; At this point, I’d already completed a weeklong training with the franchisor, yet still had not signed an APA. I was an amateur with my fingers crossed, masquerading as a pro, and offering a lower purchase price exposed that. The deal was still on the table, but that bit of shock tainted our relationship from then on. This taught me how important it is for business interactions to appear smooth and for the element of surprise to be reserved for emergencies, and those skilled in its handling. If I had presented myself as slightly less agreeable from the beginning, the contrast wouldn’t have seemed as stark when I made a lower offer, and I might’ve gotten my price. Hindsight did me no good in this case, and we eventually walked away from the deal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe fascinating contradiction here is that people do all this work instead of starting a business, yet for the same result. Some folks quit their jobs to set out as full-time searchers so that they can find a profitable business to buy instead of creating one from scratch. If you spend a year living off your savings as a searcher, you could’ve just as well spent that time opening a lemonade stand. It still comes down to time preference and risk tolerance, and it seems that there is a lot of promise in buying a business that you can profit off from day one as opposed to starting one and grinding toward the unlikely outcome of profitability. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003EStep 3\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce you’ve purchased that business, the only thing left to do is operate it. The only step in this overly simplified process that I’m entirely ignorant of, yet my ignorance will not keep me out of my armchair. From one wantrepreneur to another, I’ll now tell you how to run a business. Lucky for me, it appears that search entrepreneurs can benefit from proclaiming their ignorance in this process. Another key distinction between the zero-to-one startup approach and the one-to-two acquisition approach. Why might an entrepreneur start a landscaping business? Because they’ve mowed a lawn or two and are willing to work. Why might another entrepreneur buy that business? Because they’re willing to learn everything the first guy already has and keep the ball rolling. The laws of physics are of extreme advantage for the latter businessman. An object in motion wants to stay in motion, so if some brilliant person is already making money mowing lawns, paying them for their business and some of their time to teach you how to do the same thing is a pretty good bet. Never having run a business, this is all I can say on the topic. People go into business for many reasons, and though this post began on the topic of wealth creation, there are more rewards to be reaped in business besides money. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003EConclusion\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENothing about any of the steps here described is easy. Nothing about risk management at all is easy. Buying a house isn’t easy. Working 9 to 5 isn’t easy. Having a good life isn’t easy. The challenge is implied in the engagement of opportunity, and embracing challenge is the cost of mining an opportunity’s rewards. Entrepreneurship is the sexy label we give to a risky divergence from the most common path to a good life. Entrepreneurs are heroes on a journey fraught with challenges, though the journey of an employee can be described in the same way. The challenge is inherent in any pursuit, less it would not require action. Therefore, along with time preference and risk tolerance, an action also communicates an individual’s preference for a challenge. I decided to buy a business because I wanted to experience the challenge of running one. I want to experience risk and get used to its accompanying discomfort. Taking risks is a skill that is reflected in an individual’s quality of life. Excuse my confidence in saying so, but the quality of life I’m referring to is subjective, meaning that Range Rovers only affect the quality of life to the extent that they satisfy their owners, rather than their pricetag. If a man makes a living selling insurance for Statefarm, retires in a condo, and loves every second of it, he is an excellent risk manager. He took all the right risks to attain the quality of life he wanted. Someone who does the same and dies miserably didn’t do themselves justice and probably lived a life of quiet desperation. I want to practice taking risks while I’m living in an apartment with no dependents so that I’m confident in my skill level by the time I’ve got a house and family on the line. When I venture into the zeitgeist for my afternoon podcast, I find an imploring number of interviews of folks who risked much larger estates than mine on business ventures. Some are \u003Ca href=\"https://acquiringminds.co/articles/philip-blackett-cemetery-services\"\u003Eless successful than others\u003C/a\u003E, mind you. Others are killing it and plenty are just making ends meet. Yet, the overwhelming attitude amongst these folks is that they’re all proud to have risen to the challenge of business. I think there’s something special in the act of doing business and for that, I’ll continue looking at deals and exploring new ways to enter this arena. I’m hoping to flex my risk muscle a little harder this year and continue learning what a good life means to me. I’m glad to have you along for the ride.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf this made you think, please \u003Ca href=\"https://www.spenpo.com/blog/159\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Eshare\u003C/a\u003E it with a friend.\u003C/p\u003E\n",

          "rendered": "\n\u003Cp\u003EI took a trip to Boston to see some old friends this past weekend. We had a lovely time, but events at each end of the trip festered in my mind to the point that I found myself lecturing over them in the middle of a long walk. Do you ever wind up talking to yourself because something unexpected just happens to matter to you? Though it feels strange, I like to think back to \u003Ca href=\"https://youtu.be/VLkjaTjJXLY?t=3340\"\u003EMatthew McConaughey’s interview\u003C/a\u003E where he urged Tim Ferris’s listeners not only to talk to themselves, but to engage with the seemingly involuntary ideas and questions that come across. Having done so, I welcomed the lecture. I’ve repackaged it in the first person for ease of reading. Here it is:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI’m visiting some friends I hadn’t seen in about two years. We arrive on Friday evening for our two-night stay. I’m traveling with my wife. It’s the first time she’ll have the pleasure of meeting these fellas. We check in to our room and head to the first rendezvous at a friend of mine’s house. We enter to a surprisingly calm vibe. We must be early. Greetings brighten the mood and I’m quickly made privy to the sad reality that an expected member of this weekend’s team has missed their flight. My friend Dave had planned to pick them up at the airport before they arrived so that we could head to the next rally point in about an hour. Our plans are resting on this time constraint and the night isn’t horribly young. No matter. The soldier that’s fallen back will have to meet us out and play catch up. We seem to have consensus on the matter with one exception, Dave. He can’t seem to stop grappling with decisions. He keeps asking for second opinions, claiming it might make sense for him to hold up his end of the bargain and drive out to the airport, cutting much deeper into his night than he had originally planned for.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI’m kind of just a passenger for all this. I didn’t add much to the discussion, but I was listening in utter disbelief. My perspective was this; I’d just been reunited with some old friends and begun a weekend that would close out Sunday afternoon. If this were an equation, time would be a constant. There are endless variables that could affect the experience between then and now, but none of them will affect how much time remains in the trip. From where I’m standing, Dave is contemplating spending a couple hours in his car while turning his back to the scarcity of time that’s right before him. Granted, the variables are rather distracting. Dave could’ve been thinking it’s the right thing to do to keep his promise and give our buddy a ride. It’s one thing to see scarcity in a finite span of time, but he could’ve perceived abundance considering the weekend had seemingly just begun. Maybe he just didn’t want our other friend to miss out. That said, I couldn’t put my finger on why I was so confused in that moment. It was only in reflection that I realized the opportunity cost of losing two precious hours together was daunting to me.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI’ll admit that I must’ve discarded the definition of opportunity cost about seven years ago after my macroeconomics final. Luckily, a conversation I was having after our weekend excursion made it click for me without boring definitions. In the context of my last anecdote, opportunity cost is the price Dave would pay if he chose to go to the airport, while he would have been free to seek other opportunities if he hadn’t. The term ‘price’ is a misnomer here, as there isn’t much money involved. From my perspective, the true cost was resting on the fact that we were already together in that moment. If Dave were to forgo that moment to sit in traffic instead, he’d miss the opportunity to reconnect and enjoy each other’s company until he returned.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe second pillar of the dilemma materialized as the trip was coming to an end. My wife was already on a flight home. She went back to be with our dog while I stayed an extra week to spend time to my parents. It’s Sunday morning, and I’ll be leaving Boston to return my mom’s car in a few hours. I meet up with three of my friends for the last time of the trip. Two of the same blokes from the previous story and one other. We’re on foot to go get some breakfast. I had split from the crew around 2AM the night before and unfortunately, I forgot something at the bar. A hoodie. An old one that I keep at my parents’ just so I have something to wear when I’m visiting. A had texted everyone from my Uber and asked that they collect the hoodie since they were still at the bar. Didn’t get a response, but I didn’t sweat it. While we’re on our way to the diner I mention the hoodie and Dave tells me they couldn’t find it. Some will say I’m grasping at straws, but I believe the events of Friday night had tuned my mind to the trend of opportunity cost, leaving me at an increased vulnerability to the conundrum I’m about to describe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat Dave said next was that we could go back to the bar and look for the sweatshirt. I was silent. I must’ve looked back at him like he had told me he killed Kennedy, because the two others started to chuckle after a pause. I’m known for the occasional deadpan, so no one thought much of it, but I couldn’t come up with a response for the life of me. Eventually, I was able to muster something along the lines of, “no, man”. That was the end of it. It wasn’t until several days later that I was able to derive the nature of my disbelief. On a long walk through my hometown, I finally realized that the culprit was, once again, opportunity cost. Again, I’ll share my perspective. This was practically my greeting on the last leg of a great trip with guys I love and missed. It was known that my wife would leave early that morning, so all along I had planned for that breakfast to be the only time I’d enjoy their company without her. Quite a unique dynamic. This is true scarcity. To think that I might consider driving to a different part of the city to look under furniture for an old hoodie literally broke my brain. With only a couple hours left in a weekend with friends I may not see for another year, I wouldn’t trade that time for gold, let alone a sweatshirt.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI’m well aware I’m being dramatic, and these were not the intense situations I’ve depicted them as in this post. They were quite sober in the moment, but something was nagging me to think twice about them. The lingering discomfort was nudging me to uncover the lesson buried beneath. And in the midst of a brisk walk through wooded New England back roads, that lesson burst through my brain in the form of a belligerent scolding. The original currier must have been my ego, because I remember marveling over how smart I would sound delivering this lecture to Dave and my wide-eyed friends in the same moments I described to you. This misses the point. What happened at either end of that weekend wasn’t a missed opportunity to champion someone Dave's faulty logic. It was a gained opportunity to derive meaning from real feelings. Whether those feelings are selfish, emotional, or illogical, they are what make us act. The fact that the opportunity cost wasn't obvious to Dave or me in the moment proves it's not the most intuitive concept and probably deserves special attention when making decisions. Whether it's a weekend with your friends or the eighteen summers you have with your child, time is always a constraint. We all stand to enrich our lives by treating it as such.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIf this made you think, please \u003Ca href=\"https://introspective20s.wordpress.com/?p=156\"\u003Eshare\u003C/a\u003E with a friend.\u003C/p\u003E\n",

          "rendered": "\n\u003Cp\u003EEver heard of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.flyfrontier.com/\"\u003EFrontier Airlines\u003C/a\u003E? The low budget commercial flight service is perfect for those of us who want the miracle of flight and almost nothing else. While popular airlines commonly boast their inflight goodies, above average legroom, and top of the line customer service, Frontier found room in the market for a company with the opposite approach. The seats are uncomfortable, you’re allowed one free personal item (a carry-on will cost you), and their service reps only speak Swahili. By stripping away all frills from the service they’re able to charge the cheapest air fare in the industry. It’s an excellent unlock of value and they have a rare direct flight that’s convenient for me to take a couple times a year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI wound up in a mental pretzel on my last flight with them and had to put these thoughts on paper to clear my head. I never choose a seat when I fly Frontier because even the last seat in the back will cost extra to reserve. I’ve had good luck doing so in the past, but this time around I wound up with a middle seat. Luck of the draw. I made my way there with the second boarding group and sat in my empty row waiting to let the lucky window seater in. Something was taking them quite long. My isle seat neighbor arrived, and we kept waiting as the attendants assured us they were expecting a couple stragglers. I wasn’t on the edge of my seat as I already came to terms with my fate on a full flight. I was just happy to be young and strong enough that five hours in this wedge would hardly set me back. It’s a nice privilege to appreciate once in a while.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJust as we were being told the cabin was sealed, something funny happened. I was moments from accepting the rare gift of my neighbor missing their flight. No one had claimed the window seat, so it seemed safe to move over when someone popped up in the isle and told my row mate and I they needed to get into the seat next to me. My neighbor got up and began the routine we had both expected to carry out all along. I fell in line quite efficiently and made way for them to slide into the window seat that had my mouth watering up until this moment. It was flawless. Very few words were required to politely remove us so that we could file back into the proper juxtaposition of a full flight. I remember thinking to myself that this was a real photo finish. They even apologized for making us get up, but I was happy to do it for such a sober request.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt took me all of five seconds to begin over analyzing the situation, and by the time I was seated again my CPU was in overdrive. Suddenly the timeline wasn’t adding up. I had been staring ahead trying to contain my excitement for several minutes when our new row mate showed up. The deal was sealed once we were told everyone had boarded and no one was making their way towards us from the plane’s entrance. So, where’d this person come from? I’m starting to suffer now as speculation turns my new neighbor into a super villain. I’m wondering if it’s possible that it wasn’t their assigned seat. Could it be that they had their eyes on it and wasted no time to pounce once the doors were closed? I’m stewing in my middle seat while I get creative with this narrative.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s funny how we do this to ourselves. Riding a plane is the modest human’s way of equaling capabilities known only to the birds, and the proud human’s way of surpassing them. I have no time for such nonsense in my situation. At this point I’ve been wronged. “By whom?” wonder’s my inner monologue. Well, there’s the weasel sitting next to me, but worse, I’ve wronged myself. Why hadn’t I asked if it was \u003Cem\u003Etheir\u003C/em\u003E seat before I put it in autopilot and made way? Sure, but couldn’t they have lied? Well, I could’ve asked to see their boarding pass. And what if they copped to the charge and revealed that it wasn’t their seat, but they wanted it? Now I’ve pissed away a chance for the spotlight. I could’ve exposed them for pirating a seat that was rightfully mine. Did they really think \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E wouldn’t like to move over and enjoy the window and some extra room? I could’ve spoken up for the territory and been my own hero. Oh, and the one-liners. AH! Line after line of snarky tell-offs that would’ve banished the offender are flashing through my head. I’m a hero! I get a standing ovation from everyone on board.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI relive fantasy after miserable fantasy while the damn plane is being de-iced for what feels like a decade. The scarcity mindset poisons my self-talk while it devolves into putrid insults. “Fool”, “Pushover”, “Follower”. Suffering is officially an understatement. The real kicker is I know what I’m doing, and I just can’t stop it. I know I haven’t any proof that they poached the seat. I know that if I had prevailed and were sitting in my windowed throne, (that I had no right to in the first place), with an empty seat next to me, I wouldn’t feel any different. And I know it isn’t personal. Even if they did set out for this upgrade and get lucky that I aped into line no questions asked, they didn’t do it to hurt me. If my wild assumptions are true and their plan just happened to work, it was an impressive move. To be bested never feels good, and in the time between the incident and takeoff I had to watch myself run through this victimization algorithm like a windup toy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe solution? You just read it. I spent about an hour torturing myself until we were airborne, and I could get out my laptop to release this all. By the time we were lifting off I was finally coming around to the idea that this is what I expected all along. I’m sandwiched between two blokes on the hardest seats in the US, and after an hour and a half of typing I’m finally feeling normal. It’s easy to make yourself at home in a cruel reality like I’ve here described. I may be projecting my experience, but it’s hard for me to believe this is uncommon. There was a time in my life when I was quite fond of misery and would’ve been glad to maintain that state of mind for the entire flight. Since my preferences have changes, I often reflect on that old way of life as if it were an illness that I was able to remedy. Whether or not my self-diagnosis was accurate, the symptoms do return in times like these. When they do, taking interest in the nature of my thoughts has been pivotal in reducing time to recovery. I’m glad to be in a position to engage such issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf this made you think, please \u003Ca href=\"https://introspective20s.wordpress.com/?p=152\"\u003Eshare\u003C/a\u003E with a friend.\u003C/p\u003E\n",

          "rendered": "\n\u003Cp\u003EI’ve realized that I’m a very specific type of person. This is the case for all of us, and I believe the process of narrowing down the cohort of people we belong to also assists in determining where we can be most useful. This is a two-way street. If you decide you want to be a life coach, you will benefit from narrowing down the massive pool of coaching candidates to a more specific cohort that your unique skillset would make a greater impact on. Conversely, if you decide you want to study bacteria that thrives in wood from native New England trees, you may benefit from entering the broad community of microbiology to first get a lay of the land. Whatever the case, we know humans tend to band together in networks of varying specificity, and the process of traversing the levels of specificity of the networks you find yourself in will prove to be a powerful exercise.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI’m a person who wants to know how things work. Beyond that, I’m interested in the invisible frameworks we use. I didn’t take apart the TV set as a kid to see what was going on inside, but the first time I saw the guts (source code) of a website, I was fascinated. There’s something about the intangibility of code running in a web browser that makes me want to figure out the magic behind it all. The other invisible frameworks that interest me are in people. I am endlessly curious about human decision making. What makes someone decide to study Spanish instead of Portuguese, to start a business or get a job, to add to their retirement fund pretax or post. I have an endless backlog of questions like these, and the frameworks people use to answer them are massively under-documented. I think the parallels between software processes and intellectual processes, (how computers make decisions and how humans make decisions), say a lot about my core curiosities. I’m excited to continue bridging the gap between these two schools of thought.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMy technical curiosities have led me to a career in web development, and my education landed me in the field of building commercial applications for private companies. The cohort I’ve just described is one corner of the software community. There are numerous others, and several of them would peak the curiosities here described just as well. One example is open-source software. To draw some initial parallels, what I do is build web apps that in turn, users of the internet will give money to my employer in exchange for the privilege to use said web apps. This is a common way to leverage software in business. Open-source software is entirely different in that it is built without the guarantee of compensation. There are teams of developers just like me out there building software only because they believe it will be useful. When they’re right, the natural response of the market is for reciprocity to come in the form of donations. There are many reasons to desire a steady paycheck over the possibility of a generous donation, but as far as the type of work goes, they’re certainly in the same wheelhouse. As someone whose curiosities lie in all kinds of software products, I’ve chosen to spend some time trying my hand in the unfamiliar corner of open-source software.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis past year I’ve open-sourced four of my own projects. As a frontend developer, I often come up with neat ideas for user interfaces I think would be fun to build. This is something I’m happy to invest my time in. I enjoy honing my talents to produce something satisfying that I put my mind to, and the skills I pick up along the way make me more valuable as an employee too. I’ve recently begun to study Jim Collins’ concept of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003EThe Flywheel Effect\u003C/a\u003E. I’m still figuring out what makes mine turn, but I’d like to think it starts with following this same curiosity, which tends to produce effortless work that I benefit from in many ways. Another way I can gain from these side projects is through this blog. Each project is an opportunity to summarize what I learned from the experience and share it with others. Thinking out loud and in front of anyone who will listen is a great way to confirm or reject the ideas that I form while working in solitude. Another way to draw out some value is by showing them off. Now that I have my own \u003Ca href=\"https://spenpo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Ewebsite\u003C/a\u003E, I’ve been able to publish some information along with a demo of each of these four projects. And the newest way I can benefit from a side project is by making it open-source. The process of preparing software for others to consume and publishing it in a public forum is invaluable experience and serves as a permanent signature on a large community of developers. All four of the projects I’m referring to have been made public on \u003Ca href=\"https://npmjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Enpm\u003C/a\u003E, the default package manager and registry for consuming and distributing JavaScript based modules. I’ll now hover on each of them and do some reflecting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://spenpo.com/projects/language-flash\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Elanguage-flash\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne day I was listening to \u003Ca href=\"https://lexfridman.com/podcast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003EThe Lex Friedman Podcast\u003C/a\u003E and got an idea for a flashcards app. I outline my epiphany in the following \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/s_pop3/status/1547753107668381696\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Ethread\u003C/a\u003E. I started by gathering some data to use for Mandarin Chinese flash cards. Once I had that, I built the UI. At some point in the process, I started to think of how the app could actually be useful to a lot of people. I was building a full stack application for studying Mandarin, but on a more practical level, I was building a frontend module for studying any language. That was when I knew I should put in the effort to make it publicly available. Going from building an app with one purpose to a component with many potential purposes is an intellectual shift that I recommend all creatives explore. I had to devise a way for the consumer of my component to inject their own data, rather than building it around the data I already had in whatever way was convenient for me. I’d like to think the new perspective of an open-source developer who doesn’t know exactly what their work will be used for has made me a better commercial developer too. I use this approach to think objectively about the flexibility and configuration of the components I build for my teammates at work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://spenpo.com/projects/3x3-cube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003E3x3-cube\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I was a senior in high school, I got hooked on solving Rubik’s Cubes. I didn’t know anyone who could solve one, but I knew it was possible, so I decided to be the first. I picked it up quickly and it became a fun party trick that would preoccupy my ego through the end of high school. Fast forward 8 years, and the old obsession has become more of a sanctuary where I go to engage myself when I’m bored, anxious, confused, etc. I recently remembered using a website to try solving my older brother’s cube when we were much younger. That got the ego involved again and the first thought that followed was: ‘I could build that’. I had a blast developing the UI for entering the colors of a cube you’re trying to solve, but I quickly hit a wall when developing the backend. I realized it wasn’t enough that I knew how to solve the cube, and I needed to do some serious training in object-oriented programming to develop a service that knew it too. I didn’t want a project that I enjoyed so much to die alone in my github. There were plenty of backend services for solving a 3x3 already out there, so all I did was publish the UI component. Anyone building a react app that solves Rubik’s cubes can now import my component and integrate any backend service they want. I demonstrate this on my website by implementing a module from \u003Ca href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/cubejs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Ecubejs\u003C/a\u003E to get the solution. And I’m still interested in building my own solution, but by open sourcing the frontend I was able to publish some work quickly while the huge undertaking of coding a solve function is on the back burner. I built the component intentionally for integrating it with cubejs, and was able to see the vulnerabilities that manifested in doing so. Building a flexible component is hard. Attempting to do so has given me newfound respect for the open-source developer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://spenpo.com/projects/two-truths\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Etwo-truths\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, I’d posted demos of two cool side projects to my new website. I posted my resume on a \u003Ca href=\"https://spenpo.com/resume\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Eseparate page\u003C/a\u003E, and the homepage had links to my other work, social media, and what not. It was shaping up to be a nice little hub for my web presence. I started thinking of ways to add to the lore of that presence that would make more people come check out the site. I wanted to share some things about myself that weren’t already evident. This sparked the idea to build a little game. I wanted to share interesting facts about me, but in a more creative way than an about page with a paragraph on how cool I am. Every website has that. I decided to build a UI for the game \u003Ca href=\"https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Two-Truths,-One-Lie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Etwo truths and a lie\u003C/a\u003E. Part of my inspiration here is that I would often think of the other people that are the same very specific type as me. If there are other developers out there building a website from scratch in hopes of starting a business off their brand someday, wouldn’t they want their visitors to play two truths and a lie with them too? This made open-source the way. I wasn’t just building a full stack app for my visitors anymore. I was building a frontend module for anyone like me who wants to engage their audience. I setup the component so that any JavaScript developer could pass in a function that returns two random truths and a lie. That’s all it takes to get this game up and running if you want to include it in your site too. This taught me the power of open-source. It’s like doing the work for someone else who doesn’t even know they have to do it yet. Even if no one uses it, that’s a valuable lesson.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://spenpo.com/projects/react-timeclock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Ereact-timeclock\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA couple years ago I was building a website and wanted to start tracking how much time I was putting into it. I had an Excel sheet going where I would log what I did and how long it took each time I did some work. One day I realized it’d be so much nicer if I could just record that stuff right in the app I was building. I built a simple UI for a timeclock and put it on a random page that wasn’t intended for the production version of the app, this was only for ease of development. Well, I never deployed that app anywhere, but a few weeks ago I realized that little timeclock component was a great idea. If I wanted something like that bad enough to build it myself, whose to say there aren’t other devs out there that want the same thing? I was already in the groove with open sourcing UI components to npm, so I decided to get that one ready too and put it out there. I loved this process because I never meant for the thing to go public two years ago, and there were plenty of trials and tribulations in preparing it. I’m such a different developer now than I was back then, and I had to decide which parts to modernize and which to leave as is. I had used \u003Ca href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003EBootstrap\u003C/a\u003E for styling back then and trying to open-source a component with the Bootstrap CDN embedded turned out to be a nightmare. This was one of many lessons I learned from this project in picking the right battles as a developer. I decided I wanted implementation to be drop dead simple for this one, so anyone could just render the component and start using it. This led me to storing the data in \u003Ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ElocalStorage\u003C/a\u003E, which introduced extra fragility, but provided the ease of implementation I was going for. Tradeoffs! I love this dynamic because it encourages the developer to be future oriented. I wanted to bring this component to the public quickly, so I did. There’s nothing stopping me from building out another more flexible version where the user can integrate their own database if they want to. I also have plans to add the ability to export your timeclock as a .csv file. Dreaming about future iterations that you may or may not carry out is the whole point of software. I do hope I act on some of those dreams, and others will be better off forgotten.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI’m proud to have begun a new stock of knowledge that will round out my technical skillset as it grows. The most satisfying part has been exploring a very specific corner of software that’s new to me, while simultaneously being fully aligned with the type of work I like best. I may have learned some of this stuff as a commercial developer if I waited long enough, but I didn’t want to. And this is literally the tip of the iceberg in the world of open-source software. Now that I’ve built some components, I want to know what it takes to develop a whole library of tools for devs like me. I wonder what it takes to contribute to an open-source project I didn’t start. What would it be like to issue a pull request to \u003Ca href=\"https://mui.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003EMaterial UI\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"https://nextjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ENext.JS\u003C/a\u003E, or even \u003Ca href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ETypeScript\u003C/a\u003E? These are incredibly powerful tools, but at the end of the day they’re code bases powered by dev just trying to make each other’s lives easier. I’m excited to continue adding to this new set of skills and eventually have the confidence to contribute to efforts like those. Open source can have incredible impacts on the world, and it all starts with one developer and one idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you’re interested in all the different kinds of work I’ve got my hands in, you might enjoy my recent post about how my goals have shifted this year and how I'm approaching work lately.

          "rendered": "\n\u003Cp\u003EI’ve been on a journey to realize my full potential as a young person. I’ve done all the work that you’d think a twenty-something who would make the former statement does. I listen to audio books and tell people I “read”. I pontificate on the meaning of life. I even meditate once a month just so I can keep saying I do it. This is all excellent, but something was missing. A hole in one’s life is a bad feeling, and I’m not going to say I’ve gotten to the bottom of this one, but I have theories. I’m not here to riff on a one size fits all remedy that solves bad feelings. I’m just here to report something that’s helped me. I realized there are two different kinds of work I do. As a young professional, there’s work that I do to make myself more marketable. This includes all the work that earns me a salary and ultimately benefits my employer. Though that work is performed to make a company money, it’s also performed in the hope that it adds to my stock of industry knowledge and makes me a more valuable employee. Most are referring to this when they refer to “work”. The other kind is work that I don’t want people to pay me for. Things like studying nutrition, reading philosophy, and taking long introspective walks. This is the kind of stuff I do just because I think they’re good things to do. The stoics called it self-actualization. \u003Ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/566JKlhA3qfPSBHDLrPDDB?si=c3CrRq_mT06pdGby8bhGUg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ERyan Holiday constantly reminds us\u003C/a\u003E about Seneca’s cold plunges and Cato sleeping on the floor. It’s quite the misnomer, but those interested in their full potential would also call these things “work”. A friend of mine recently turned me onto the term “self-improvement junkies”. I dig it. The problem is I get lost in all this “work”.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere’s a certain number of long walks you can take before you look up and ask, “where’s the day gone?” That’s the bad feeling. I was talking about this with a friend when I realized I was spending too much time trying to transcend, and not enough trying to move forward. I think the problem might be in giving such different efforts the same attribution: work. Since then, I’ve been attributing my work based on the intention backing it. Work that I do for myself goes in one bucket, and work that I do for my career goes in another. Striking a balance between these buckets is of interest to me. I strive to go above and beyond professionally, and I’m lucky in that the work I do as a web developer is much more than a means to an end. I write code to pay my bills, but I also do it because I feel like it. The main reason I started doing it in college was that it sounded better than the jobs my peers in the business school were getting. I still hold this sentiment, and coding has been as much of a sanctuary as a source of income for me over the years. This has me sometimes doing very similar work to that I get paid for in my free time as well. But I’m a man of many interests. I truly just want to become the best person I can be, and though coding is part of that, so is taking cold showers. So is sticking to a strict workout routine. So is spending entire afternoons in nature. But this is what I meant about “getting lost”. There was a point when I realized, (probably in a cold shower), that I’m a professional web developer but I don’t even have a website... That’s the bad feeling. The buckets were off balance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI decided to be intentional about the type of work I did for the next month. Outside of my nine to five, I started to divide up my free time into work I do to make myself more marketable, and the rest. It’s weird how the buckets can so easily become blurred. There’s plenty of ways to move forward professionally, and who’s to say those won’t help you transcend as a human too? They will. That’s why intention has become so important to me. When \u003Ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://youtu.be/kFQUDCgMjRc?t=7368\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Easked for his thoughts on work/life balance\u003C/a\u003E, billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya responded that balance is limiting. He then described his process as, “monotonous and regimented, but it's all the time, except when it’s not, and that’s also monotonous and regimented.” My interpretation is that he’s working towards serious professional goals, but he also knows when it’s time to work towards other things instead, and he wants to be all in during either time. This is what I mean by intent. There are certain things I do for a specific professional goal, and others for a more ambiguous goal of wellbeing. Neither type of work is superior, in fact both are imperative to feeling good. I’ve found that when these types of work aren’t properly balanced, they both start to seem futile. If philosophy is the love of truth, it doesn’t make sense to do nothing else but study it. You’ll have no use for the truth! In a much more apparent sense, professional goals become futile without a likened goal of transcendence. Though we all seek transcendence where we please, the loneliest, emptiest people are rightfully depicted as those not seeking it at all. And it’s often been said that the search is really the good part anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, I’m constantly experimenting, trying to find the right balance between them. It’s caused me to dial back the truth self-actualization at times and set some hard goals that develop marketable skills. It's good to reevaluate your own balancing act ad hoc. Since doing so I’ve finally put up that website that I’d been too caught up in deep breaths to build. Many will find themselves in the opposite camp, focusing far too much on their career. If this is you, try to believe that you can create your identity from much more than a resume. There’s a lot more you can do with this consciousness we all share. Get to know it! And don’t be upset by the imbalance. I constantly feel myself sliding in one direction or the other. The only compass I go by is how I feel. I hope this dares you to think about the work you do differently and come up with new reasons for doing it. It might just take a shift of intent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me, writing can fit into either bucket. Though my blog has been focused on introspection so far, you might also enjoy my professional work. I’ve written my first technical post on how I built my website.

My blog will still come back to introspection, but its purpose has always been to explain the things I do. Creating content is an attempt at teaching. It’s a way to summarize an understanding you’ve gained. It’s been said that you don’t know very much about a topic until you start teaching it to others. Assuming this is true, writing about the thing you want to become an expert at is a great way to hone your craft. Well, there are many crafts I wish to hone, and though deep thought and self-reflection are paramount to all crafts, the thinker should also be a builder.

The backend is a simple Express.js API that can be used to supplement any features needing outside data, of which there are currently four. The database is PostgreSQL. These three main services all have separate build processes that produce a docker image, and docker compose is used to deploy each image to a container and run them together on my production server. All the infrastructure is in AWS. The server is an EC2 t2.nano instance, which is the smallest instance Amazon offers. If you choose to run Amazon Linux 2, (AWS’s in-house Linux distribution), it is also the cheapest option at $0.0058 per hour. Running this site will cost about $51 per year.

There’s a homepage, projects, and resume. The homepage is made up of four features, two of which are React components. There’s a box labeled ‘check out my latest post’, another labeled ‘see what else I’m working on’, one labeled ‘send me an email’, and all the way to the right is my twitter feed. The first one has a link preview below the heading which will open my latest blog post in a new tab when clicked. This is a small react component that I built myself. A link preview is like a hyperlink that shows the user some additional information to make clicking there more attractive. They commonly display an image, title, and description of the link, so I knew something like that would be a better user of web real estate than a skinny blue hyperlink in the middle of my site. I was surprised to find out that the link preview, though an increasingly universal concept, is a commonly centralized web feature in organizations. This means that Twitter has their own link preview that they display for you when they find a hyperlink in your posts. Facebook, Medium, and other social media companies probably have the same type of thing, and comb through their users’ posts to render their shinny link preview component. \u003Ca href=\"https://andrejgajdos.com/how-to-create-a-link-preview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003EThis article\u003C/a\u003E explains how their components are likely quite advanced, using a web scraper to find open graph tags that hold the data they need for the preview. Learning this was quite tempting, but I decided not to get distracted by the lure of having my very own link preview api like the companies I’ve mentioned. The next option was to go open source, but I was disappointed with the flexibility of most link preview components I found on npm. I found that all I really wanted was a dumb component that looked the way I wanted and displayed the info I wanted. When I realized I could probably build that from one row of data and less than a hundred lines of React code, I just started. The thing is just one .jsx file that calls one of my endpoints to get the data it needs and renders them in the HTML elements I setup. The data is in my site’s Postgres container, so if I want to update the link, I don’t even have to redeploy the site, I just log into the server and run an insert query in psql. This gave me all the control and customization I wanted for a fun little half-day side quest.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Twitter feed works the exact same way. It’s another single file React component that just calls the Twitter api with my username and renders my tweets in the exact format I want them. This isn’t to say that the open-source route wasn’t an option again. In fact, there’s a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-twitter-widgets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Emarvelous library\u003C/a\u003E with a React Timeline component that I’ve used in past projects. Projects like that are great, but I took this as an opportunity to fiddle with the Twitter api on my own and build something I knew I was capable of in order to avoid another dependency. And if you’re wondering, the other two pages on my site work similarly. The resume page is nothing but a React app. The projects page is setup with a table format and uses JavaScript to display apps based on the user’s selection. There are Svelte apps in there too! I’ll go over that in another post. So, I built two little React apps for my site. Now, how do I get them in there?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI found that loading react directly in the HTML like they describe \u003Ca href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E was the easiest way to add them in, but ultimately bloated my codebase and slowed down the site. This is because it’s loading a compiler, which is a complex piece of software that translates React into something the browser knows what to do with. JSX is compiled by babel, which takes a combination of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS code and compiles it into a few JavaScript files and one CSS file. This is what happens when you run \u003Ccode\u003Enpm run build\u003C/code\u003E. If you bootstrapped your app with create-react-app, it uses the react-scripts module to invoke babel on your project and compile it down to those production ready files. Since I only wanted to include small React features in my primarily static site, all I needed were those couple files from babel. React works by rendering elements to one specific element that you tell React-Dom to look for, so as long as that element is on the page and I’m importing the production files, voila, my component gets mounted. There are plenty of ways to stage this for rapid development, but I needed to come up with a way to do all this crazy compiling beforehand so that my server only needs to look at a couple HTML and JavaScript files. Remember, the site’s running on a virtual machine (VM) with half a gig of memory.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDocker solves all of this. I mentioned that my site’s three services all have independent build processes. These are all configured by a Dockerfile at the root of their respective directories. The Dockerfile for my client-side service can be found \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/spope851/meDotCom/blob/main/client/Dockerfile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. This is a multistage build process that compiles all the different JavaScript framework-based features in my site and integrates them with the static html codebase I’ve setup. By ‘integrates,’ all I mean is that it takes those compiled files we talked about and puts them in a directory that my static site is ready to import them from. Hosting a site on the web requires a web server, so I chose to use the official Nginx Docker image as mine. The image is a virtual machine that has Nginx properly installed and ready to serve some code to its visitors. All you have to do is put the code you want it to serve in the right place, so that Nginx can find it when someone’s browser asks for it. Docker makes this easy with its lovely COPY command. On line 6 of the Dockerfile I copy “.” (all the files and directories in the same location as the Dockerfile), from my computer into the following directory inside the Docker container: /etc/nginx/html. That means when the container is running, Nginx will be able to see my index.html file for my homepage and my /projects and /resume directories, so it will have everything it needs to serve my static content. Now, we’ve still got to get those JavaScript files in there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is where \u003Ca href=\"https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Emulti-stage builds\u003C/a\u003E come in handy. I already said that all we need to \u003Cstrong\u003Erun\u003C/strong\u003E the site is a web server, so we’re using Nginx for that. But in order to \u003Cstrong\u003Ebuild\u003C/strong\u003E the site, we need different software. Well, the point of Docker is not having to run a bunch of crazy software that might not play nice together. If I need Node.js to build my React apps, but I don’t want to be bugging Nginx in production, Docker makes it so I don’t have to mix my chocolate with my peanut butter. I can start a separate VM in the same Dockerfile and do all that compilation independent of my web server. You can see on line 1 of the Dockerfile that I use the FROM command to start a container with the official Node.js Docker image, and directly after that I name the build stage ‘builder’. Doing so allows me to start a new build stage from the image that comes out of the builder stage in the future. The only thing I do to the Node image in the first stage is install git on line 2. That means everywhere else in this Dockerfile where I start a stage with \u003Ccode\u003EFROM builder\u003C/code\u003E, I am starting with a fresh Node image that has git installed. As you can see, the rest of the stages all involve the same pattern of starting from the builder image, cloning a repository with my React code in it, installing the app’s dependencies with \u003Ccode\u003Enpm i\u003C/code\u003E, compiling the code with \u003Ccode\u003Enpm run build\u003C/code\u003E, and copying all the compiled code into the container. Then, the build stages that use my web server image copy only the compiled production files from the builder container into the directory my html files will be trying to import them from in the Nginx container. For example, \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/spope851/meDotCom/blob/main/client/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Ethis file\u003C/a\u003E is expecting to find a file called main.js in the following location relative to its root: /react-apps/home/js/main.js. It will be looking for the file from inside the Nginx container, which is why the hraServer stage, (home react apps), copies the production files from the /build/static directory in the hraBuilder Node container into the following directory inside of Nginx: /etc/nginx/html/react-apps/home/. Each build stage is setup with this pattern so that all of my framework-based features are compiled inside a clean Node VM and then the necessary files copied to the appropriate place in my web server. This also enhances local development because it takes a good minute or two to install dependencies and build one of these apps, so if you want to test some changes on only one of them you can use the \u003Ccode\u003E--target\u003C/code\u003E flag to stop building the image after a particular stage. The resulting image that comes out of this Dockerfile is a very lightweight version of Nginx with access to only the necessary client-side code properly oriented for my site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI then tag all the images and push them up to my personal Docker registry in DockerHub, and then the only thing my server needs to know is where to find my custom image. Since my site is a multi-container application, I use Docker-compose to share this information with it. Compose allows me to start multiple docker containers with one .yml file like \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/spope851/meDotCom/blob/main/docker-compose.yml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E. As you can see, my client service is pulling the meDotCom-client image from my personal corner of docker hub, denoted by my username. The only other trick involved in that service is using the \u003Ccode\u003Eport\u003C/code\u003E flag to map port 80 inside the Nginx container to port 80 in the computer running docker compose. In this case, that computer is my EC2 instance, which is configured to route traffic to the default HTTP port, which is 80. This just makes it so that going directly to my domain, (spenpo.com), routes you first to the server that is my EC2 instance, and then to the VM inside the server that is my Nginx Docker container. Configuring the instance to port 3000 instead would just mean that users must go to spenpo.com:3000 to see my site, which isn’t as convenient as the default port.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis sums up the entire client-side service. The resume page is also an HTML page with a single \u003Ccode\u003E&lt;div&gt;\u003C/code\u003E element waiting for those JavaScript files to bind to it and render my resume react app. The projects page is mostly the same except it has some extra JavaScript \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/spope851/meDotCom/blob/main/client/projects/projects.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E that controls which app you will see in the table depending on which tab you’ve chosen. I think this has set me up with a sustainable way to continuing to integrate more of my projects with the site without significantly bloating the codebase each time. And the build process happens almost entirely on my own laptop, so anytime I want to make changes I just tag a new image and push it to docker hub, then log into the EC2 instance and run \u003Ccode\u003Edocker-compose pull\u003C/code\u003E and restart the container.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003EStorage\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI chose PostgreSQL for my site’s first database because I only needed support for a couple select queries and Postgres integrates well with Node.js. Another advantage was that the official Postgres Docker image has a nice feature where any SQL scripts it finds in a special directory will be run when the database is being initialized. The image relies on another directory at /var/lib/postgresql/data for caching the data that the user keeps in the database. If Postgres finds some data in that directory, it doesn’t bother with initialization when starting the container. Therefore, I mount a volume of that directory to my project’s root with Docker Compose. It makes it easy to test out scripts, because all you must do is remove that directory and the container will perform initialization the next time it starts. This makes adding outside data support very strait forward. I have a couple scripts in the sql directory of my project that get copied into the init.d directory of the container while my custom Postgres image is being built. One of them creates all the tables for my project. This means anytime I want to add support for new data I just add a new create table statement to that script. The three tables I create with that script right now store the data for my link preview component and the data for two of the apps on my projects page.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI’ll always know what data I want to go in the link preview when I’m getting ready to deploy the site, so I keep an insert script in that same directory that adds a row to the table my link preview is pulling from. What makes this initialization trick even more powerful however, is multi-stage builds. I built the language-flash app on my projects page because I wanted to make something that would help me learn the most common words in a new language very quickly. I found a Wikipedia page with the 1000 most common Mandarin words, and naturally used Python to scrape them into a JSON file. I’ve always used Python for gathering data from the web, it might well be the only thing I remember how to use it for at this point. The problem is I don’t want a 1000 item JSON array sitting on my production server. Once I decided I wanted to publish the app online, that data obviously had to go in a database. Well, since I already had that nice script, I just tweaked it to spit out insert statements instead of JSON objects and changed the extension of the output file to .sql. Then in my Dockerfile, I added a build stage called scraper that uses a Python image to run the script, and the only thing left to do is copy the output of the script into the Postrges image.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI was ecstatic to see how well this pieced together. I’ve done plenty of projects where the data layer rests on a manual execution of some Python scripts, but this was the first time I had to get that data production ready. Creating this process got me thinking about all sorts of cool stuff I could do with the same architecture. Last year I was building a trading app that relied on data from the NBA to track players’ stats. If I ever released that project, I would’ve needed an ETL that was running my python scripts every night and sticking whatever they found in my database. There’s so much nuance that makes this a wildly different process than scraping some data one time and sticking it into Postgres. It’s pretty fun to think through, how would you do it?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003EBackend\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe backend is one Express.js API right now. Though it’s the simplest piece of the puzzle, it’s still a crucial tether between the client container and the database. The Node Docker image makes it easy to run your own API in a container, and Node easily connects to Postgres via the pg package. The only tricky part here is lining up all the ports so that the containers can talk to each other. Picture the Node container holding two tin cans, one to each of its ears. One of those cans is on a string where Postgres is talking into a can on the other end, and the other is on a string where Nginx is listening on the other end. I’ll start explaining at the Postgres end.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you start a Postgres container it runs on the default port 5438. This was fine with me, so I left it that way. That’s just the internal container port though, (I know, this again). In order to get the two tin cans connected, the two containers must go through the ports of the computer they’re both running on. For this reason, I use Docker Compose to map port 5438 in the container to a port specified in the environment variables in the host shell, (my EC2 instance). Then I set the $PGPORT environment variable in the Node container to the same variable in the shell so that it can use that when connecting to Postgres. There’s a nice npm package called pg that handles the database connection once configured. All the API logic is currently in one single file called server.js. In this file I import the \u003Ccode\u003EPool\u003C/code\u003E constructor from pg and feed it all the data it needs to connect to my database. The five things it needs are user, password, host, database, and port. Docker Compose makes it easy to pass this information in from the shell it’s running on. Since the user, password, and host of the Postgres container are set via environment variables too, I set those same variables for the Node container so that I can pass them to the \u003Ccode\u003EPool\u003C/code\u003E constructor from the \u003Ccode\u003Eprocess.env\u003C/code\u003E object. The port must match the outer port that the database container is mapped to, and the host is just the name of the service running Postgres. Once that connection is established, we can query our database! New instances of the \u003Ccode\u003EPool\u003C/code\u003E constructor have a property called \u003Ccode\u003Equery\u003C/code\u003E. This is a function that takes a string of valid SQL code. Running the function \u003Ccode\u003Epool.query('SELECT * FROM mandarin;')\u003C/code\u003E will return a promise with the result of the query in JSON format. So, if everything is properly linked, meaning the Postgres image built properly so that the data from our Python script was initialized in the database, and the correct environment variables were set so that Node can connect, then the tin-can-telephone should function as intended, and that promise will resolve to an array of the Mandarin words and their meanings that we mined from Wikipedia. Wrap those few lines of code in a good old-fashioned Express GET request, and our API is ready to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENow that Node can hear what Postgres has to say, it’s time to hook up Nginx’s phone line. This will be quick. If you’ve started and Express server before, you know the last order of business is to run the function \u003Ccode\u003Eapp.listen()\u003C/code\u003E and pass in the port you want it to run on. More fun with ports! The problem is that will run on the Node container’s internal port of your choice. The solution comes through some custom configuration in our Nginx container. It’s a common maneuver to write a custom default.conf file for situations like this, and then replace the stock file that comes with the official Docker image when building a custom image. We can use the \u003Ccode\u003Eupstream\u003C/code\u003E directive within this file to proxy incoming requests to wherever else we want them to go. Since I’ve named the backend Node service ‘\u003Ccode\u003Eapi\u003C/code\u003E’ I use the first three lines to tell Nginx that any requests to the api service should be sent upstream to my backend service which is running on api:5000 (hostname:port). Then below in my server rules I set up a rule for requests with the path \u003Ccode\u003E/api\u003C/code\u003E. The rule says when a request matches the regex \u003Ccode\u003E/api/(.*)\u003C/code\u003E it should be rewritten as a request to my upstream server with the same path as the incoming request. This means that a request to /api/foo/bar will be rewritten to http://api:5000/foo/bar. The advantage of this complicated dance is that it makes our lives easy when making requests to the backend service from the client side. Whether it’s from static HTML or a JavaScript framework, all I have to do is call my endpoint with \u003Ccode\u003E/api\u003C/code\u003E in front of it to get some data from my server. This way, I won’t have to scour the app for every request if I ever decide to change where my backend is hosted. It provides a lot of extra control from a very simple, yet powerful file. This is one of the features of Nginx I’d like to learn much more about.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe tin can phone lines are all hooked up now, and my client-side apps can get data out of Postgres that will be served to them by Node. This system is flexible and can be easily customized. If I build some kind of data aggregation app, I can add a MongoDB container and integrate that with my api. The Node service already has some endpoints that make subsequent requests to elsewhere on the internet, and the beauty of it is that it will proxy my requests to anything I can add support for. This will give me the freedom I wanted to experiment with different tech stacks and showcase what I’ve built all in one place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003EInfrastructure\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe cloud engineering of this project has been made unadorned by courtesy of Docker Compose. This is the first site I’ve deployed to the internet on my own, and my experience configuring servers up until now has been minimal. The way I protect myself from my own inexperience in this case is by keeping most of the action off the server. The less you have to do on your server, the less likely you are to mess it up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI used to work for a company that had its production servers in a closet somewhere in the office. Once a month we would do a product release, and I was invited to these meetings to watch in awe as our devops engineer would wipe each servers’ file system clean and proceed to reinstall Node.js to ensure a stable environment. The number of times I’ve seen Node installed on an elderly Windows box is insane. We’d perform this ritual for what usually took one hour. Other activities on the call were things like cloning projects onto the server and installing dependencies. Exciting stuff. And all this time the product was down, (we worked nights once a month to do this for the convenience of our customers). The moral of the story is that’s a whole lot of work that must be done on the production server. Even when we automated this process, we would still watch all the same commands get run in order, leaving the system fragile if we were to add a new software solution to the mix. I plan to be adding new software to my site on a regular basis, so I also want to minimize the number of chances there are to mess up my server.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy pushing the custom images I’ve already built on my local machine up to DockerHub, I can now run my entire site with one compose file. The server also doesn’t need to spend any time building my project. Sometimes those images would take five minutes a piece for my mac to build, so I don’t want that stress on my server, and I also don’t want to pay for a server with that much memory when I only really need it for the builds. Right now, my client image build process has to clone four different repositories, install their dependencies, and build all the projects individually, all just to copy a couple resulting files into the final Nginx image. Doing so eats up gigabits on my computer every time I create a new build, but then the image is only 130mb. Keeping the three images’ combined weight below 0.5gb is imperative for being able to run them on a t2.nano in AWS. I believe this is the cheapest server space there is for a project of this complexity. And complex as it may be, all it takes on a brand new EC2 instance is installing docker and docker compose to get this thing going. I took the liberty of installing git on it as well so that I can easily pull changes down when the compose file gets updated. And that one file is truly the only thing the app stands on. If I didn’t want the source files from my repository sitting on the server anymore for some reason, I could remove them. I could even remove git and use \u003Ccode\u003Escp\u003C/code\u003E to copy the compose file from my laptop to the server over ssh. And t’s far from continuous integration but stopping the containers to run \u003Ccode\u003Edocker-compose pull\u003C/code\u003E before starting them right back up is less than a minute of downtime for site maintenance. I plan on looking into using \u003Ca href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003EAWS Codepipeline\u003C/a\u003E for automating the pipeline with a git hook. I’m not sure if it supports containerized apps, but I’m sure there’s something out there for automating docker-based pipelines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn conclusion, this may seem like a purposely convoluted portfolio site that could easily be a single page app hosted for free on \u003Ca href=\"https://vercel.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=17166484769&amp;utm_campaign_id=17166484769&amp;utm_term=vercel&amp;utm_content=134252114537_596484707957&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA14WdBhD8ARIsANao07gwl-KIs7k6z1QlbxTOx9wYBq8HwTeBtGaJIXAlGVyiXrJ4yieJWvsaAjSREALw_wcB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003EVercel\u003C/a\u003E, but that’s no fun. Building this site was an excuse to learn so many new webdev tricks that I wouldn’t have found from my day job. I’ve gained great experience with AWS from using load balancers to configuring DNS in Route53. I’ve setup a software development life cycle that has plenty of room to grow into something modern and advanced. I’ve also designed a local development environment that lends a hand to the unfamiliar tech stack I chose. Half of this stuff is still crystalizing in my brain and all of it is good material for future articles. I’m glad I’ve got a project to refine, and more importantly, I’ve got somewhere on the web for my work to be shown off. I’m excited to keep building.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIf this made you think, please&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"https://introspective20s.wordpress.com/?p=130\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Eshare\u003C/a\u003E&nbsp;with a friend.\u003C/p\u003E\n",

In fact, we all are, and if you started reading just for a chance to derive my privilege from this click bait title, I hope you at least go away with an understanding of this fact; we are the richest animals in history. The luxurious wonders of technology that we enjoy at nearly every level of the social hierarchy these days wouldn’t be worth trading for a king’s wealth of five hundred years ago. I live next to a homeless shelter that I’m humbled to walk past daily. When I pass by, I can often observe most people there captivated by a small backlit touchscreen lying in their palms’. A high speed, handheld computer with sixty-four gigs of storage and wireless connection to the internet would rock the minds of the brightest engineers of 1990, yet today they’re available to all. Although royalty may sound pretty good from where you stand, all the gold in ancient Rome couldn’t get Starbucks delivered to you in ten minutes, or plan a remote vacation without moving your feet, or send your voice around the world in the time it takes us to make a phone call. The confidence that we wear on our sleeves in public is a representation of tremendous societal progress that has assures us no need to fear for our safety in the presence of strangers. A short time ago, equivalent piece of mind was priceless.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENow that we’ve practiced some daily gratitude, let’s talk about disease. It isn’t news to you that mental health is commonly mishandled by one of the most diverse populations in all of medicine. While children under five were the main risk group for polio, and now COVID is particularly dangerous to the elderly, depression affects those of all ages, and race, gender, or status won’t keep you safe either. Although we live in the most efficient age of yet, the clearest constraint to mental health is one that no one can get ahead of; time. My father has drunk three ounces of orange juice every morning since the regime, because he believes that a few milligrams of vitamin C are a hack to his immunity. Everyone wants a time sensitive prescription like this. Sadly, I don’t have any silver bullets to present to you. Caring for your state of mind can be like taking care of a puppy, it feels great when you’re super into it and everyone is cheering you on, but if you take a day off you wind up with pee-stained carpets, torn up house plants, and pissed off roommates. I’m not saying you must meditate in a full lotus every day to keep from getting depressed, just like you shouldn’t strap the puppy to your chest 24/7. It’s more about keeping an eye on it. I’ve found routine to be imperative in the process of improving any area of life, but I believe that all routines must be closely coupled with graceful deviation. This entrepreneur \u003Ca href=\"https://youtu.be/bkPwFqa89gE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Esums it up perfectly\u003C/a\u003E when he describes the tendency of high performing individuals to create superstition around their routines. In his words, “That’s bad!” and it’s hard to argue with a mustache like that. I think I’ve pontificated enough, so I’ll get into the meat of this post now. A word of caution; this is free advice, so to you it may be worth just what it costs. Here are the lifestyle changes I’ve concluded to be pivotal to my mental health:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELevel One: Cut out \"regular\" stress\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStress is inevitable. Everyone has a stress hack that doesn’t actually work. I don’t care if you give up all your possessions and become a monk, your baseline will even out, and one part of your day will be comparatively more stressful than the rest. Stress is not bad. If it weren’t stressful to hear a fire alarm, many would burn alive due to their lack of urgency. Of course, listening to a fire alarm all day would be harmful. There is a point where the amount of stress that compels us to useful action converges with the amount that is physically and mentally destructive. Most functioning people are teetering throughout life somewhere within one standard deviation of the mean of our populations stress levels. The system I’m giving you with this post is for anyone whose found themselves way outside those bounds with no idea how to get back. So, stress is not good or bad, but a necessary evil. When I view stress as a misfortune that’s been cast upon me, I feel powerless. But when I look at it as information coming from the choices I’ve made in my own best interests, I realize my agency in the transaction. Accepting the fact that you elected to take on stress in exchange for something of value is the key to navigating level one. This is because understanding the reason you are experiencing stress allows you to plot that instance either between or outside the upper and lower limits, and then logically decide if that experience it worth it’s yield. I hope this system is useful to you, because I think it’s important to simplify what’s involved when situational stress becomes nuanced. Remember, you’ve ended up in this state for a reason. Evaluate that. Lacking such a system, I often used to find myself submitting to stress and allowing it to normalize in my mind. Accepting that was dangerous and eventually landed me with above average stress levels on a regular basis. So, it feels good to play with the idea that we opt into all our stress, but what if we plot a point that we can’t opt out of? I think many of you will find that your most stressful encounters are of such high yield that you can’t part with them. This is where the tail end of level one’s theory comes out; we all have a threshold for stress. If you think of yourself as an empty cup, then the threshold is the rim. When the cup is full, more stress won’t do you any good so it’s in your best interest to cool down and allow it to empty. The core teaching of this theory is that if your job, lifestyle, and choices subject you to frequent stress, you are still free to observe your relativity to the threshold. Watch it carefully. In his moving commencement speech titled \u003Ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/4yNz82ya3VhwT9ntGiAX9D?si=92924a79631b499f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003E“This is Water”\u003C/a\u003E, David Foster Wallace describes our duty to perform such periodic checks on ourselves, and the discipline involved in making a habit of doing so. If you’re able to do so for an extended period, you’ll end up with a dataset representative of your average stress levels over time. You may be surprised to find that you, (the cup), are often more than half full and very seldom less. This is an epidemic that I think \u003Ca href=\"https://youtu.be/M8uiNaZpO8o?t=16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003EBill Burr illustrates\u003C/a\u003E when explaining to his wife how he seems to, “go from zero to a hundred in two seconds”. If you’re idling at seventy-five, you shouldn’t be surprised that your “regular” stress is consistently too much. Empty the cup. It’s possible some of your stress has been miscategorized as “regular”. It’s ok to submit to the stress when you must make a living or your family is depending on you, but if you don’t tread lightly, you won’t notice when the cups halfway full for no reason. Make your business to take inventory of this and find low hanging fruit that you can pick to lower your baseline stress little by little. Here are a few sneaky ones that I used to carry around in my “regular” stress basket, and have found tremendous relief from leaving behind:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003EEat less carbs\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s possible that your baseline stress has been indefinitely elevated due to inconsistent blood sugar levels. This may be due to the excessive levels of grain-based carbohydrates that commonly dominate our diets. I don’t have a diet to sell you, and I don’t plan on discussing the highly nuanced field of nutrition with you today. I’d much rather leave you with the simple adage that you are what you eat. This method can be further simplified to the advice; “eat real food”. Peter Attia provided useful parameters for that when he said, “If it comes in a package, it’s probably not food”.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003ECurb your information diet\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I was a teenager, a friend I respected told me with pride that he watched the news every night over dinner, and I remember feeling sheepish for not being able to tell him the same went for me. It’s funny how perspectives can change, as I feel the exact opposite now and am still guilty of the charge. It is my firm belief that most of the free media available to anyone with cable or internet does not aim to inform, but simply to solicit a reaction. I will not be elaborating much on this topic. It will be obvious to you if you expand your regular stress checks to cover your hours of leisure. I’d only like to give a gentle reprimand that if you are investing your spare time in consuming content that works you up, you should be skeptical of that. For some helpful methods you can read chapter six of Tim Ferriss’s \u003Ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Expanded-Updated-Cutting-Edge-ebook/dp/B002WE46UW/ref=sr_1_1?gclid=CjwKCAjw3cSSBhBGEiwAVII0Z65B79xx_7j-G7Lomfc7TOOCGsfT_X8nKwEDTUFTkYz3DSIamsco8hoC_fcQAvD_BwE&amp;hvadid=409943032485&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=1014517&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=8816612223653314777&amp;hvtargid=kwd-6853771301&amp;hydadcr=24657_11410751&amp;keywords=the+4+hr+work+week&amp;qid=1649516376&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003E“The 4-Hour Workweek”\u003C/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\"https://tim.blog/category/low-information-diet-and-selective-ignorance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Echeck out his blog post\u003C/a\u003E on the matter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003EDrop caffeine\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStimulants are a remarkable discovery, but if you haven’t found yourself marveling at that fact in recent, you may be misusing them. However, I am not here to present a review of the literature to you. Google around about the effects of caffeine and you’ll be able to find sufficient information to confirm any narrative you’d like. I’m only here to tell you my experience, which is that I felt fine as a coffee drinker, but after quitting I feel much better. I’ve been all over the spectrum on this one. In my days of working in an office where there was free coffee, I would certainly drink my fill. I had a roommate in college who always kept a bottle of caffeine pills around, and they sure did come in handy. I’ve also been on the controlled side of things where I would allow myself a coffee at breakfast and lunch exclusively. None of these phases were crippling to my health or energy, but without any caffeine I just feel better. I’d like you to simply consider the shot clock that begins decrementing every time you spike your energy with caffeine. Observe yourself in this state and imagine what your baseline stress would be at if you could leave that dependence behind. That’s available to you if you want it. \u003Ca href=\"https://youtu.be/mGDA_Sn_5OA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003EHere\u003C/a\u003E is a guide that was useful to me when quitting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELevel Two: Frontload the stress\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENow we’re going to take things in the opposite direction. Level one was about managing stress. You’ve sourced all your stress and consciously chosen to keep some of it. Being able to identify and triage stress is a vital first step towards feeling better. This is akin to a boxer’s agility training. It is imperative for them to learn to avoid being struck by their opponent. But the boxer is aware that they will inevitably get hit, and \u003Ca href=\"https://youtu.be/_YYmfM2TfUA?t=65\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Ethey prepare for this as well\u003C/a\u003E. Level two is about enduring stress, because if you’re always an empty cup you may find yourself ill prepared when stress does rear its ugly head. Therefore, I think it’s important to purposely experience stress with the intent of learning to better control it. I also think subjecting oneself to unpleasantry teaches self-confidence and mental resilience. Please explore level two with those qualities held firmly in your minds eye. Setting out to build self-confidence will allow you to increasingly break through barriers you once believed yourself incapable of conquering. This not about self-torture, but rather self-actualization. I play with the inputs I’m about to share with you and plenty others, just to continuously test my resilience and find out what I’m capable of. It’s not so important that you push yourself to the limit, but rather that you come to understand how far off your limit really is. Biology is quite clever in this way. Discomfort is the brain signaling the body to conserve energy that will be useful for protecting the life of the organism. In other words, “STOP”. This served us well when it was possible a predator would catch us by surprise at any moment. Conserving energy by avoiding that stress allows you the bandwidth of an empty cup should you need to run for your life. So, if you’re safe from becoming something’s dinner, you may find value in some of these techniques for building up your stress tolerance:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003ETime restricted eating\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELet’s begin again with diet, which is much more than just eating less. Changing how much you eat can be useful for controlling one’s weight, but the full range of nutritional benefits are only realized by also controlling what you eat and when you eat. Notice that in level one I suggested, “eat less carbs,” rather that flat out, “eat less”. There is an important distinction there between dietary restriction and caloric restriction. A third one known as time restriction completes \u003Ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?extid=SEO----&amp;v=1184005012070786\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003EPeter Attia’s framework of the three levers\u003C/a\u003E. Time restricted eating (TRE) has become mainstream by the moniker intermittent fasting in recent years, but I would still consider it the most underutilized tool in the realm of dieting. I’d encourage anyone experiencing stress to go down the rabbit hole of TRE just to take in some of the astounding research. I think this lever goes perfectly with level two because it is a slider, not a light switch. You can fast for twelve hours per day, sixteen, or twenty-four. You can have breakfast four times a week and skip it three. You can eat what you’d like one day and then nothing the next. There is no shortage of strategies out there and each one is a test of your true potential. If you think this is something you can’t do, that makes it the perfect test for you to start training yourself to believe you can do much more than you think. Hunger can be stressful, but if you are a willing student, it will teach you to widen that threshold. My final sentiment on the topic is that digestion is also stressful. As one of the most energy intensive and therefore distracting bodily duties, I believe that digestion pairs poorly with most tasks, and would recommend you strategically plan for it around your periods of stress volatility (your “regular” stress). Multitasking is the enemy of productivity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003EExercise daily\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPhysical fitness can more accurately be termed physical stress endurance. If your tummy rumbling is the body’s way of saying, “STOP FASTING,” then the burn we feel in our muscles is it saying, “STOP MOVING”. The extent to which you can keep going anyway is a measure of endurance. Anyone who wants to expand their productive capacity must start with exercise. This is not about health, confidence, or energy, (although all three will thrive). It is about the wisdom that will come from understanding the concept of progressive overload. Give it a Google. Progressive overload is a cornerstone of level two because it embodies the key teaching that you must start where you are and move forward. The root word progress is all we’re after here. It’s very simple; pick up a weight, and if you can only do five reps, great. Come back tomorrow and do six. If you can only run for five minutes, great. Tomorrow let’s go for five and a half. Five seconds? Great, you know what to do. This same concept can be applied to any discipline you want to improve, and exercise is the surest one to observe its merits through results. There is no end to the research you could do in this field, but I suggest you start as small as possible. Many of us have some experience with working our whether it’s from playing sports or messing around with mom’s dumbbells. I assure you that there are infinite resources on the internet that you can dive into at your own pace, but if you’ve never been to the gym before, then just start walking. Use your smart phone to find out how many steps you’ve been taking on average and tell yourself you’re going to beat it. Then beat that the next day, and again the next day, and the next day. I strongly encourage you to focus on daily cardio above all else, but the point is just to do something every day. This is not a lifelong prison sentence and remember; it’s a slider. If you’ve been walking ten thousand steps per day, but tomorrow you only do five, that’s still something to be proud of. Five thousand steps! Get back out there tomorrow and beat it. Maybe one day when you’ve got a lot of time you want to go for fifteen. Or maybe you’re sick of walking and today you want to try running sprints. Surprise the body, it will thank you for the variability.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003EAssisted introspection\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHere’s one you can’t google. Assisted introspection is a term I’m coining for any practice of mindfulness with the help of some preferable intervention. Hear me out. We’re all sick of millennial bloggers shoving meditation down our throats. While I believe it’s a useful tool, it’s extremely difficult to pick up and even harder to make a habit of. Also, most people just don’t want to do it, and I get that. I don’t want to advise everyone reading this to take a break and do nothing for an hour every day. It would be a beneficial prescription, but for many it isn’t practical and trying to fit that into your day can end up creating more stress where we’re trying to remove it. I recommend going down the meditation rabbit hole if you’re interested, but the mindfulness practice I suggest here will be much easier to start and stick to. Assisted introspection is taking something you already enjoy and doing it on your own. The intervention can be chemical, physical, or informational. A few examples of what chemical intervention might look like would be fixing yourself a drink, having a coffee, or taking an edible, and then just sitting there. Now, I know I just finished telling you to drop caffeine and now I’m contradicting myself saying you can have a coffee, but the whole point of this post is really that you can do whatever you want. If you enjoy having a coffee, don’t swear off it for life because some guy with a blog said that’s the way. There are no silver bullets here. Quitting caffeine won’t make you happy no matter how dedicated you are, I just think breaking the addiction makes it easier to be happy. The point of assisted introspection is just to get you to hang out with yourself, and if formalizing your private time with a cocktail helps get your ass in the seat, that’s worth something. I’m by no means encouraging you to get blasted by yourself. I am against all forms of substance dependence, but I don’t believe in always or never for anything. What I really want for my readers is to get you all thinking about yourselves. This, you will find, is stressful. Doing nothing is truly one of the hardest tasks there is because those who are unskilled in self-reflection have learned to immediately seek a distraction when there’s nothing left to do but think. If you can’t sit by yourself for ten minutes because that roommate in your head won’t shut up, try answering them for once. I would argue that drowning out that voice in your head makes you more susceptible to stress, while listening to it over time will decrease your stress volatility. I implore you to find a healthy way to enjoy your own company. Physical intervention might look like taking a walk or riding your bike, but always cap your session with some alone time while sitting still. The duration is up to you, just remember progressive overload. You don’t have to time yourself, but I like to look at the clock before and after sitting down just to get an idea of how long I went. If you have roommates, do this somewhere where it won’t be interrupted. An informational intervention might be a chapter of a book you like, a podcast, or listening to your favorite song. The possibilities are endless, so find out what puts you in a meditative mood in a short amount of time. It won’t take long to find something that works for you. When you’re ready to start your practice, allow yourself to think about as much or as little as your mind wants to, and don’t judge yourself for any thoughts that come across. Every time you do so, you’re adding that time to your stock of knowledge about yourself. That is an indescribable advantage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELevel Three: Surprise yourself\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELevel three is where I urge you to dig deep. Some of my ideas may start to sound crazy here, but if you’ve made it this far, I ask that you continue through with an open mind. Level two was all about empowering yourself to endure stress by subjecting yourself to healthy forms of it. Level three is where we can test whether it’s working or not. There’s something special about surprising yourself when you’re trying stuff like this, and this level sets you up to do just that. Think of it as a dress rehearsal. The methods I suggest below will not provide a direct measurement of your ability to handle the stress that you commonly experience. What I mean is that I don’t have a way to directly test your composure when stuck in traffic or being scolded by your boss. However, the following methods do provide a litmus test for your general stress threshold and baseline. I hope you find them to be a useful blueprint and allow your creativity to tailor them to fit your needs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003EExtended fasting\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe human organism is a system, the body of which is comprised of subsystems that harmonize in the creation of a thrilling experience we call consciousness. And we spend a great deal of this experience marveling at other systems that outperform us. We study the whales, tortoises, and other sea creatures that commonly outlive us. We obsess over automobiles for their speed, and computers for their throughput. The aforementioned systems are all remarkable, but I think what sets humans apart in many categories is our near perfect energy efficiency. As a diurnal mammal, we’re capable of sustaining energy throughout the day and well into the night if needed, and we can exert or conserve it based on reason. We require a great deal of input to make all this happen, but we’re able to process extremely efficient fuel sources with the stomach. It isn’t a showstopper on its own, but the development of cooking eases the digestive process and greatly increases the stomach’s efficiency. This is one of many examples of humans channeling their intellect to enhance the performance of some system they utilize or operate. These are the two methods of energy management that allow humans to excel: throttling up or down to control the strain on a given system and channeling the intellect to distribute the strain more evenly. Analysis of each system in the body will reveal some implementation of one or both methods, whether voluntary or involuntary. Each night, we rest our visual, vascular, and cognitive systems while we sleep. The same goes for more than just the eyes, muscles, and brain. Throttling down most of our bodily components at the end of the day is the most common implementation, but we see it in plenty of other abbreviated manners as well. We throttle up our legs and heart if we must walk to the store, our renal system when ingesting potentially dangerous toxins, and our reproductive system when we stand a chance to mate. The ability to choose when these subsystems should be employed or lie dormant contributes to their preservation and the overall longevity of the parent system. The extent to which we can rest each component also sheds light on how effective the rest can be. Back to sleep for a second, during which the muscles can power down fully, but the heart still must idle to some extent. This helps us make some sense of how much more common heart failure is than muscular deterioration. Diet is a perfect instance of energy management for the digestive system. Being strategic about when, what, and how we eat enables us to control the amount of crucial rest the stomach, intestines, and other components are rewarded. The most common fast that humans indulge in is the eight hours we spend sleeping each night, so it’s no surprise that the rejuvenating effects of that fast can be enhanced by practices like eating the last meal of the day well before bedtime and avoiding midnight snacking. The patterns just described speak to the prevalence of digestive issues among humans as well. Most people give their stomachs a reasonable break overnight but aside from that they’re pretty much always chowing down. We’re very good at throttling the background process of digestion up and down, but generally aren’t concerned about the amount and quality of rest that subsystem gets. Our culture makes it evident that it’s a good idea to take extended breaks for certain systems. For instance, frequent gym goers will take a week off from all forms of exercise, athletes have an off season, and CEOs will even take sabbaticals. But most people don’t have a natural proclivity to rest. It’s common to hear about success stories of entrepreneurs or athletes who were overworking themselves at one point and were then able to perform better by resting more. It seems though that digestion is still slipping through the cracks for many. I think I’ve driven the anatomic metaphor far enough home, but the point is that your stomach is a powerful asset, and the more attention you pay it the harder it will work for you. If you’ve never gone a day without eating, give it a try. It will be uncomfortable at first, but the distinction between pain and discomfort is an important one to get a grip on in your quest to properly manage stress.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003ECold exposure\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESteven Kotler \u003Ca href=\"https://www.successpodcast.com/show-notes/2021/1/21/unlock-peak-performance-amp-get-more-flow-in-your-life-with-steven-kotler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Edescribes grit\u003C/a\u003E as performing at your best no matter how bad it feels. I guarantee you that challenging yourself to embrace cold water will exemplify what grit means to you. Experiencing the numbing discomfort of a cold shower will reveal how strong your body is and how weak your mind can be. Once you’re completely dry after a session of cold exposure, you’ll find yourself unscathed, and likely better than beforehand. If you want hard facts about epinephrine, dopamine, and other chemical reactions the cold can trigger behind our skin, I implore you to stroll leisurely through the various rabbit holes of ice baths, cold showers, and polar plunges (apologies for all the homework). Although I’ve been down them myself, I don’t lay any claim to the physiology, and I sustain a practice of cold exposure only for the primitive reasoning that IT FEEL GOOD. The grit will first appear in your teeth, but if you’re consistent with your onboarding you’ll soon find it to have moved into the mind as its permanent dwelling. And while the grit in your teeth is replaced with a relaxed and confident jaw, the grit in your mind will thereafter serve as a straightforward reason to get back in that shower tomorrow, the next day, and so on. If you want to truly understand the dichotomy of the physical and the mental, you must unravel them individually. I think cold exposure will give you a window into your physical toughness and open your mind to the possibilities of what you might be able to endure mentally. Doesn’t it sound logical that after starting your day in a freezing cold shower, getting a stain on your shirt won’t even phase you? This is just another way that physical stress does a world of good for the management of mental stress that we can’t predict.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003EUnassisted introspection\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first time I heard of fermentation, an art teacher described it to me as weighing down vegetables inside of a crock and letting them rot for weeks. At sixteen years old, I did not take well to this overview. It wasn’t traumatic for me to hear that, but it was enough to get me to steer clear of any fermented foods for about six years. Then when I was out of college and onto some sort of gut health renaissance, the magic of letting those veggies rot was revealed to me. Fast forward to today and there’s a two-liter mason jar full of salty cabbage right over on my counter that’s been sitting out for weeks. Good stuff. The point is I already knew what fermentation was, but the way I was told of it made all the difference. Meditation is the same for most of us. I cringe at the sound of the M-word. The idea that anyone would sit criss crossed waiting for Jesus to take the wheel sounds like boring hogwash. Not to mention the stigma. Whether you’re literally picturing \u003Ca href=\"https://i0.wp.com/i2.cdn.turner.com/money/galleries/2008/news/0804/gallery.summer_movies/images/love_guru.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003EMike Meyers in The Love Guru\u003C/a\u003E, or just some dick millennial from your yoga class, no one wants to be the one who won’t shut up about meditation. It gets a bad rap and I’m here to rectify that so, if I didn’t lose you with that sauerkraut anecdote, I hope you’re still with me. We already talked about introspection in level two, and all I want you to do now with the unassisted version is see how much of yourself you can bare. If you give it an honest try and feel weird after sitting by yourself for three minutes, then that’s where you’re at. Three minutes is a fine progress report. And what is it that’s really removing you from that chair? That’s right, stress. If all that madness weren’t swirling around in your head, you could sit there for as long as you wanted. That’s all you needed to know; there’s still work to be done. The problem with meditation culture is people take it so seriously. The space is flooded with startup founders and breath counters and fart sniffers that never seem like they’re having any fun. Well, all I’m telling you in this article is to use progressive overload to make yourself feel like a badass. Don’t embark on an introspective journey expecting to become Steve Jobs, Jerry Seinfeld, or Naval. Just start doing it little by little so that you can be even more yourself. Once you’re comfortable with who you are, you’re unstoppable. To sum things up, sit somewhere private without any incentives to do so and just see how long you can stand your own company for. Then, when you want to stop, just walk away and take note of how you did. The only thing left to do is tell yourself next time will be better.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003ETLDR:\u003C/h3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI find the human body fascinating and it wasn’t until very recently that I discovered the impact our choices can have on it. I’m lucky to have grown up healthy, with an active lifestyle, and always at a normal weight. I didn’t notice the level of comfort I had with my health until three years ago when sheer boredom, (I let my postgrad lifestyle become far less stimulating than it had been in college), lead me to begin some general research. I was interested enough to start trying the ideas I was reading out on myself, and that’s all I can say for the methodology. I haven’t done any controlled, double blind, official kinds of studies. I just absorb information, change my own habits, and observe the results. Such a journey cannot be abbreviated and I’m not even sure it can be completed either, but I’ve been able to make two broad conclusions since embarking:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Col style=\"list-style-type:1\" class=\"wp-block-list\"\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChange can be unwarranted while still offering profound potential for growth.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEven though the squeaky wheel gets the oil, you can always give the other three chrome spinners… Ok, I had to put that in, but crass axioms aside, none of the knowledge I’ve shared here offer the flashy aesthetic function of chrome spinners. To abuse the metaphor even further, I was not a squeaky wheel whatsoever three years ago, and if I had changed nothing about myself back then, I’d be fine right now. However, I cannot discount the results that a few years of conscious tinkering have shown me.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E2. Channeling agency towards a desirable outcome is psychologically impactful.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have undoubtedly experienced this in some capacity whether it’s watering a plant, studying for a test, or asking for a date. Experiencing the yield of a calculated decision you made is the essence of inspiration, and every person is an instrument with which they can capture that. In you lies the free will that serves as proof of your power when successfully implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI know we went in every possible direction to get here, but those were the only two things I wanted to get across. Everything I’ve offered in this article has been revolutionary to my wellbeing, stress levels, and happiness. But don’t take my word for it. Try it out, keep what you like, and leave everything else behind. I once heard professional bodybuilder Stan Efferding say that \u003Ca href=\"https://youtu.be/ySUrqIRaCvU?t=200\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Eevery diet works\u003C/a\u003E, sticking to it is all that matters. So, if you want to eat carbs, drink coffee, or hit the sauna instead of an ice bath, do it! Because it’s not about how strictly you diet, how long you meditate, or how psycho you are in your routine. It’s the chase. Build the habits that make you perform best, and never be satisfied having done them well enough. That’s how I stay happy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf this made you think, please \u003Ca href=\"https://introspective20s.com/?p=115(opens in a new tab)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Eshare\u003C/a\u003E with a friend.\u003C/p\u003E\n",

So, we look at that which challenges us with discouragement. Rather than swim across a river, we would much rather walk until we find a bridge, no matter how long it might take. We envy the bird, even though there’s little logic for the desire to be that other creature. This envy comes from resentment of the opportunity before us that fear warns not to embrace… the same reason we must embrace it. If we ever want to declassify that river as an obstacle, and traverse it without wings, but with equal ease to the bird, we have to dismiss fear.&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEvery obstacle confronts us pregnant with many babies of fear. Those are to be ignored. We have no obligation to these babies and they do nothing to fortify the obstacle, for it is still only a river, unchanged, we must resist our subjective feelings. The opportunities so far described are plenty. There’s opportunity to extinguish fear by refusing to recognize it, for its nature is that of a flame fueled only by attention. There’s opportunity to find a way through the obstacle rather than around it, thus weakening all its siblings we’re likely to meet in the future. This process of dismissing fear and welcoming discomfort is the only way to eventually adopt the mind of the bird. Going around will only breed more fear and envy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so the obstacle exists only in the mind. They do nothing and win nothing in actuality. The only thing they represent is a subjective misunderstanding and refusal. Reject this natural refusal and run toward the fear.

At that point it will issue its own dismissal ♥\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf this made you think, please share with a friend.\u003C/p\u003E\n",

What I share will not sound like an interesting conversation, but what I later extracted from it is what I think will be helpful for you in your quest for accurate thought.  What I noticed opened my eyes to the power of suggestion which I believe will become a recurring topic on this blog. We'll find that although an inadvertent process, we undertake suggestions constantly whether done in the conscious or the subconscious mind, and I'll prove to you today how mischievous the subconscious mind can be if allowed to toil on its own for too long. I hope you'll excuse the crass anecdote, as very little context and almost no substance will be required to get the point across. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe were discussing the fear of poverty and the conversation had simmered down to the point where it was reduced to the abundance of misfortune in the world. I decided to offer the idea that some people believe everyone can be rich. I left out Naval's name to see what they thought of the theory on its own. To no surprise, it was met with immediate disbelief. There's no need to paraphrase, but my friend had a good reason to believe the such a thing was impossible, just no good reason why. I poked at their doubts by confessing that I was completely ignorant to whether the theory held water or not, as I'd never considered what it would take for such a situation to be realized. I'm admittedly still only a messenger having no original thoughts on the subject. At that point we both knew we wouldn't be taking to the debate stage on this on this one, and our conversation's quiet engine could no longer be revved up by the topic. I was met with affirmation, as my friend realized they hadn't sufficiently entertained it either, and neither of us expressed willingness to do so that night. We passively deserted.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reason this friend of mine was so confident in the theory being false was because of the power of suggestion. Anyone else who had been raised in the past two decades would also consider the scarcity of riches to be common knowledge. Our environment causes us to iterate over this idea so extensively that by now it's become reality to us. This is because thoughts, although extremely powerful, are not very picky as to their inputs. Each suggestion made to the mind is treated the same way whether based in fact or fallacy. We all know what we believe to be true because that's the reality we've allowed our minds to create from our dominating thoughts. Therefore, how could we even consider the merits of an idea we're hearing for the first time when it directly contradicts our subjective reality? This would be equivalent to a toddlers arm attempting to arm wrestle with that of a blacksmith. In other words, thoughts become fixed in proportion to the extent that you think them, just as muscles become strong in proportion to the extent they are used.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is not to say that what you believe to be true is nonsense. We each see the world through a colored glass that is tinted based on the clarity of our thoughts. It is therefore our duty to control those thoughts, and to be critical of their validity. This process should be thought of as a routine audit. Consider your mind the company that employs thoughts for the mutual goal of your success. Acting as an independent third party in this meta-cognitive exercise will allow you to effectively thin the herd. Play the role of many members of the third party committee and never let a vote be unanimous. By this I mean always leave a place for further speculation to be resumed in future audits. Being honest about what you're presently unable to prove will bring clarity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis post references the following \u003Ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Einterview\u003C/a\u003E at 1:41:30\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf this made you think, please share with a friend.\u003C/p\u003E\n",
