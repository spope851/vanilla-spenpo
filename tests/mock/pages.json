            "rendered": "\n<p>I'm a 27-year-old man who enjoys travel, dining, and programming. I live in Shanghai, China where I recently dove into the thrillingly unconventional life available here to willing expats. What I love is working and traveling, both independently and combined. I tried out the extreme combination of the two known as <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">digital nomading</a> back in 2021. I loved it, but I've grown to appreciate the utility of a semi-permanent home base. Back then I was calling it a search for the best place to live, and I concluded my search in Fort Collins where I stayed for the better part of three years. That was also when I reconnected with, started dating and eventually married an old friend from high school. Living in China had been on my radar since I first visited in 2019, so when the opportunity to move here presented itself we decided to take the plunge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Early life</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a pretty normal upbringing in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England\">New England</a> region of The United States where I went to school and played sports. I had no idea what to do with a life back then and don't think I even understood I would have to do something with mine. I went to college in New Hampshire which felt a world away from my hometown in Connecticut. I realized the real world was around the corner just before turning 21 in the summer following my junior year. I read <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Rich-Dad-Poor-Teach-Middle/dp/1612680194\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Rich Dad Poor Dad</a> that summer and got pretty pumped about adulthood while simultaneously denying its legitimacy. During graduation, as all my peers were posting on Instagram about entering \"the real world\" I was commenting \"There is no real world\". I don't know what I thought was going to happen next, but I still refer to that as the time as when I \"came online\".</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reformed business student</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I studied business in college. Didn't even know what that meant when I signed up. The business school at my university was&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/media-gallery/lightbox/7234/10244\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nice</a>, so I just went with it. I quickly realized I had no interest in becoming a salesman, accountant, or financial professional. Then I took a class where we built a website for the final project, and the rest is history. I finished business school and did fine but focused most of my education on technology. The real joke is now that I built a career on technical skills I study business in my free time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Professional?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I still do not know what I want to be when I grow up. I'm fine with that and still live every day pretty grateful I woke the heck up that last summer of college. I don't want to attribute it to a cliche book like&nbsp;<em>Rich Dad Poor Dad</em>, but something changed in me that year. It probably wouldn't have the same effect if I reread it now. My first years of young professional life taught me a lot about what I did and didn't want, and now, four and a half years after graduation, I continue to wonder what those things are and be critical of what I think they are.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Interests</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I am fascinated by economies and how humans use their creativity to keep this civilized game going. One of the most amazing business tools that I'm endlessly interested in is the Internet. The very reason we're talking right now. The fact that you're accessing this website over a wire that any computer in the world can connect to is beyond me. I'm in awe just thinking about it, and those are the things I love most. When I look at New York City and think about how a bunch of people built that while they were going about their lives a couple hundred years ago, I'm just in awe. How the heck did they pull that off? I also like cooking.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My ideal vacation?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I love Asia. I've only been to a few countries, but the contrast between Eastern and Western cultures is amazing to me. As an American, traveling to an Asian country is shocking to me. I like that. I don't like beaches or any of the mainstream excuses to party that masquerade as urban tourism. I actually don't even really like sightseeing. I just like getting to know a new city no matter how big or small. I always make a lot of time to not have plans and just wander with my head up and eyes open. Sometimes even the least impressive new places can be marvelous in unique ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Anything else?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that's enough. I like reflecting in public, but there's usually more of a point to it. I always try to convey what I learned from whatever experience I describe in my blog posts. Well, I hope you learned something about me here. If you want to keep up with me, everything I'm doing can be found on this website. If you want to know what I'm doing now, check out my \"<a href=\"http://localhost:3000/now\">now</a>\" page. I don't use social media much, but will occasionally&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/s_pop3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tweet</a>&nbsp;something I think is neat. Even Twitter, I don't check weekly or even monthly. If you want to get ahold of me,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://spenpo.com/contact\">email me</a>. Otherwise, I hope to see you out there.</p>\n",

            "rendered": "\n<p>I'm now a fourth-grade teacher in Shanghai, China. This is a significant career shift from software development that I'm glad to be embracing. At the end of 2023, I found myself on the job hunt unexpectedly. Though I wouldn't have chosen it, it also served as a period of reflection that I welcomed. During this time I explored many alternative career paths that we, (in our 20s), have the luxury to consider. A few months in I took an impromptu trip to East Asia to visit an old travel buddy who had just started working there. I spent the bulk of my days in Shanghai and also took several small excursions including <a href=\"https://pope.love/pub.php#elephant_mountain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Taipei</a>, <a href=\"https://pope.love/pub.php#guangzhou\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Guangzhou</a>, and <a href=\"https://pope.love/pub.php#shenzhen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Shenzhen</a>. Exploring these dynamic eastern cities was energizing and left me enthralled with the nostalgia of my first trip to China in 2019. I found that there is high demand here for English teachers, as the 2020 pandemic drove many Western expats out of the region. The friend I was visiting came here to fill a teaching position at a private school, and after meeting his employer I was excited to return home with job offers for both my wife and me.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"teachingInChina\"><a href=\"#teachingInChina\">Teaching in China</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The school year has begun, and I'm neck-deep in a new world. For the most part, my days look like any teacher's would. I get up early, walk the dog, and start my commute. I make coffee in the teachers' lounge before heading to my classroom to greet my co-teacher. My class prep consists mostly of file management and using the printer. Of course, there are also many distinctions since this is a bilingual school in China. Our primary school has eight class periods per day, three of which are taught in English by yours truly. The others are taught in Chinese, so each homeroom is equipped with one national and one foreign teacher. This is a great dynamic, as we split all the classroom duties outside of teaching like decorating, recess, and discipline. We also help each other circumvent the ever-present language barrier. Teaching has proven to be a fun job, though at the core it's administrative like any other. Many of my consistent todos have their parallels with the less sexy duties of corporate knowledge workers. The fun part is giving lessons, which is a calculated performance and a test of wits. Uncertainty is unavoidable, as student receptiveness varies across topics. Trying to get twenty kids to understand something new about a foreign language is an interesting game. There are good and bad days, and when a lesson doesn't go as planned, the need to change one's approach is undeniable. That's one example of the many instances as a teacher in which I'm glad for my background in software. Taking an agile approach to teaching has me treating each week like a sprint and each lesson like a user story. This analogy may earn some more thought in the future, as the agile methodology has proven to be the best way to work in many of my life's pursuits, which still holds up in teaching.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"stillCoding\"><a href=\"#stillCoding\">Still coding</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven't stopped programming since I stopped working as a programmer. My <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://spenpo.com/projects\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">projects</a> continue to grow in numbers, and I regularly update my <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://spenpo.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">personal website</a>, which is a long-running project in itself. Recently, I've been optimizing the site's content management strategy. My blog has been available on my website for a while now, and all of that feature's data is stored in a database managed by WordPress. Used in this manner, WordPress acts as a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/glossary/headless-wordpress/#first-what-is-a-headless-cms\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">headless CMS</a>. A CMS is an application used for storing static content, and headless means the application doesn't come with a front end. It is only concerned with managing content, and the way that content is displayed is up to consumers. My website consumes the CMS via WordPress's built-in REST API, so when I write my posts in WordPress's text editor, they magically appear on my website too. I've started to move towards this approach for all text content on my site. Features like the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://spenpo.com/home\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">home</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://spenpo.com/about\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">about</a> pages are primarily text, so they are better stored and easier to update in a CMS. One feature I haven't been able to integrate with the CMS is my <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://spenpo.com/resume\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">resume page</a>. I built a custom widget to display the contents of my resume, and that content wouldn't be nicely organized to fit into the widget if I just threw it all into a WordPress post. Adding resume-specific data tables to the WordPress database would make it much easier for consumers to use that data the way I intended, and for me to update my resume in the future. It's a good thing WordPress is open source, and their data models can be extended to achieve this. I can also build a plugin that will act as the CMS for the new data tables, enabling me to update my resume from a custom WordPress view that I get to design. I'm still at the drawing board on this project, and it's potentially a much larger undertaking than I anticipated, but it will be a great opportunity to learn how to develop a plugin and work with technologies I'm less familiar with like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mysql.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MySQL</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://php.net\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PHP</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technicalCertification\"><a href=\"#technicalCertification\">Technical certification</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There's no denying that teaching fourth grade for a year will leave a gap in my technical resume. It's the kind of gap I'll be excited to explain someday, but I want to stay ahead of the curb and start building my defense early. Technical projects that I develop independently are part of this, and I've decided that certifications will supplement the professional dimension of my continued enrichment. Now that the only formal work I'm doing is as a freelancer, earning well-known certifications will show that I'm still serious about a career in software. I'm starting with AWS since it's the platform I've used the most, and I was able to pass the Certified Cloud Practitioner exam with relative ease. The second-handedness of getting certified to display my competence is troubling because ideally, my work would speak for itself without the need for credentials. And given the <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tech-certifications-worth-the-effort/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">mixed opinions</a> on some of these certs, I never gave them much thought while I was employed. But, the reality is my live projects do not require the scale or elasticity needed to justify premium cloud providers, so I've opted for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kx_1NYYJS7Q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">budget infrastructure</a> to reduce their expenses. Though I can speak to my experience with these platforms, tangible proof that you've used Azure, GCP, or AWS is always best, and I can secure that by sitting for a few tests. If nothing else, they ought to serve as helpful refreshers too. I plan to earn the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification in the next few weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"learningMandarin\"><a href=\"#learningMandarin\">Learning Mandarin</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven't left behind the original reason I came to China during college. Though I'm not currently a student, I make a point of taking an interest in the language here. In America however, I fail masterfully at convincing myself to study foreign languages. I excelled in Spanish class for the first half of high school, but I dropped out my junior year at the first sign of difficulty. I couldn't justify enduring the subject. I draw a parallel from that experience to studying Chinese, which I was happy to engage in during my trip to Beijing, but found impossible to keep up upon my return. Embarrassingly, I have sunk scores of hours into a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://spenpo.com/projects/language-flash\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">software project</a> designed to help me study Mandarin in part, just to avoid the study itself. Luckily moving to Shanghai has made this study non-negotiable. I'm constantly learning new words and speaking tactics from my friends, neighbors, and colleagues. The opportunity to apply my training in my daily affairs is motivating enough to engage me. I hope to formalize my studies soon in order to increase my rate of progress. Foreign speaker Vitalik Buterin has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/categories/translations.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">entire blog posts</a> that can be read in Chinese characters, and though I don't claim to possess genius approximating his, I think such a display of competence is achievable for many. Not to mention the exciting prospect of implementing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">internationalization</a> on my website, following my journey to becoming bilingual.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"additionally\"><a href=\"#additionally\">Additionally</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My content diet continues to evolve with my interests. I've added a 40-minute commute to my daily routine, much of which is spent riding the subway. As is customary in Shanghai, I spend the entirety of the ride on my phone where I engage in reading <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_Punishment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Crime and Punishment</a>, hearing news from <a href=\"https://yaronbrookshow.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Yaron Brook Show</a>, or self-studying Mandarin with <a href=\"https://www.chinesepod.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ChinesePod</a>. My wife and I also exercise in a gym a few days a week when I listen to any other podcast episodes I've marked or the audiobook of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Atlas Shrugged</a>. These sessions only include resistance training and stretching, as my cardio has been substantially offloaded to our daily walks, bike rides, and regular weekends dedicated to urban tourism. Occasionally I'll take the short jog or long walk down to the Huangpu River promenade we're lucky to live in such proximity to. Here we enjoy a <a href=\"https://pope.love/pub.php#lujiazui\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">unique southern view of Lujiazui</a> from the Pudong side of the river, a formidable opponent to our sizable commute and any other obstacles associated with our new lodging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",
