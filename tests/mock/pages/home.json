My reasoning was a combination of entrepreneurial thirst and wanting to get to work in my community instead of on the interwebs for once. Here's how that went.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"zwt-wp-lnk-prev\"><a href=\"https://spenpo.com/blog/159\">view here</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"latestPosted\"><a href=\"#latestPosted\">The latest thing I've posted</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I recorded this video on how I integrated Vercel's \"<a href=\"https://vercel.com/domains\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">buy a domain</a>\" functionality with my website. There were a couple key tricks that leverage some of the newest Next.js features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"zwt-wp-lnk-prev\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-THJgafWuM\">view here</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tinkeringWith\"><a href=\"#tinkeringWith\">What I've been tinkering with</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I interviewed for a role where I would have been building web apps with XML data and&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">XSLT</a>&nbsp;style sheets. In preparation, I used that stack to build a file-sharing feed. I have a private server with&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pope.love/pub\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">one public directory</a>&nbsp;that I use as a file-sharing alternative. I used PHP to extrapolate data from that directory into XML format and then wrote a stylesheet that turns the boring /pub/ page into a nice looking feed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"zwt-wp-lnk-prev\"><a href=\"https://spenpo.com/projects/file-feed\">view here</a></p>\n",
